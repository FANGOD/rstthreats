                        "After about five minutes, the VM showed up in Alibaba Cloud Security's \"Assets\" page as pictured above, and various vulnerability and configuration information could be assessed. Next, the TeamTNT script Kubernetes_root_payload_2.sh, which has been modified to send all network traffic to a Google Cloud VM rather than the actual TeamTNT server, was transferred to the target EC2 instance.<crlf>The script was run first without root privileges, which caused a large amount of permission denied errors for the removal of various files and directories, then with sudo. The cloud defense impairment functions worked as intended, shutting down the agent and removing all related files. There was a systemctl service left for aegis but it was no longer running. From the Alibaba Cloud console side, the connection to the agent and thus monitoring of the EC2 instance was lost. The XMRig configuration and other files were created in the directory /usr/sbin/.configure. Originally, before the script was modified to not contact the actual TeamTNT infrastructure, XMRig was downloaded from the IP address 85.214.149.236. A new user home directory, \"hilde\", is also created with an authorized SSH keys file that's available in the same extracted files directory.

                        "Cybercriminals who are outed by security researchers must update their tools in order to continue to operate successfully. As defenders, we can learn a lot from the updates made by these cybercriminals. The tools used by TeamTNT demonstrate that cybercriminals are increasingly comfortable attacking modern environments such as Docker, Kubernetes and public cloud providers, which have traditionally been avoided by other cybercriminals who have instead focused on on-premise or mobile environments. Successfully deploying malware in these modern environments requires cybercriminals to get creative when it comes to avoiding detection, as we can see from TeamTNT's efforts to disable cloud security services. Network defenders must also get creative when it comes to implementing new forms of detection and monitoring if we are to ensure the ongoing security of these systems.",
                        ".) TeamTNT is of interest due to its use of techniques that target modern development operations environments such as Docker, Kubernetes and public cloud providers, long avoided by malware authors who traditionally stick to on-premise and mobile environments. Basic analysis of the functions and their capabilities is provided below, followed by the results of setting up a virtual machine with the defensive security agents targeted for impairment and running the TeamTNT tool to test their actual behavior. IOCs identified and defensive recommendations are also provided.",

Similarly, the sudden creation or expansion of an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume mounted to an EC2 instance to an unusual amount of utilized space may indicate a full blockchain has been downloaded, which some cryptominers perform. Of course, the defense impairment techniques themselves can be detected. At a simplistic level, if monitoring agents such as aegis unexpectedly go offline, that is concerning. Cisco Secure Cloud Analytics has a substantial amount of additional monitoring around various defense impairment techniques, but it is focused on AWS and Azure services not Alibaba Cloud Security.",
                        "agents are also targeted. This is of interest as while the majority of the malicious scripts target Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) virtual machines, these agents are most commonly found running within Alibaba Cloud Elastic Compute Service (ECS) or a Tencent Cloud VM. They certainly could be installed on a VM running within AWS or any other service, however, that would be somewhat unusual. TeamTNT does not make any attempts to disable the AWS CloudWatch agent, Microsoft Defender, Google Cloud Monitor, Cisco Secure Cloud Analytics, CrowdStrike Falcon, Palo Alto Prisma Cloud, or other common United States cloud security tools.<crlf>A version of the Alibaba defense impairment functions has been extracted from the script Kubernetes_root_payload_2.sh and",

Additionally, while most of the mining scripts are configured to use 70% of available CPU power, rather than 100%, this would still be apparent through the SCA Cloud Security Posture Management dashboard if that is monitored.",
                        ", from an intelligence partner. According to our intelligence partner, the malware author modified these tools after they became aware that security researchers published the previous version of their scripts. These scripts are primarily designed to target Amazon Web Services (AWS) but could also run in on-premise, container or other forms of Linux instances.<crlf>Besides the primary credential stealer scripts, there are several TeamTNT payloads focused on cryptocurrency mining, persistence and lateral movement using techniques such as discovering and deploying onto all Kubernetes pods in a local network. There is also a script with login credentials for the primary distribution server, and another with an API key that might provide remote access to a tmate shared terminal session. Some of the TeamTNT scripts even contain defense evasion functions focused on disabling Alibaba cloud security tools. The focus on compromising modern cloud environments sets TeamTNT apart from many of the other cybercriminals encountered by Cisco Talos.<crlf>This post describes the functionality of the various scripts provided, serving as a \"field guide\" of sorts for further analysis and provides centralized documentation for all indicators of compromise and other atomic intelligence attributes. Any alerts that may be triggered by the malware are described as well, though unfortunately, there are no AWS or cloud API calls made. The",

Specifically, it has the standard history control and clearing, file locking and permissions modification, DNS modification and package management update functions. It also installs XMRig and the bot at http://45.9.148[.182]//bin/bot_root/$C_hg_SYS and turns it into a rootkit that will persist across reboots if possible. Finally, it downloads the grabber.sh script and executes it.<crlf>Kubernetes_root_PayLoad_1.sh<crlf>This script has many of the same functions as GRABBAR_aws_cloud.sh for checking system variables, exiting depending on the hostname, and updating packages and DNS entries on the victim system. As usual, it checks the system architecture using the command uname -m and saves this as the variable $C_hg_SYS. Its primary function is downloading a script hosted at the URL \"http://85.214.149[.]236:443/sugarcrm/themes/default/images/SugarLogic/.../TNTb/$C_hg_SYS\" and saving it as \"/usr/bin/dockerd_env\".

It then will attempt to connect to root@127.0.0.1, echo a Base64-encoded version of the MoneroOcean script to the SSH terminal, decode it and run it. Next, it downloads the same MoneroOcean setup script from GitHub using cURL and tries to execute it again.<crlf>Kubernetes.LAN.IP.Range.sh<crlf>This script's primary purpose is scanning local IP address ranges and then deploying various miner payloads to any Kubernetes clusters or other instances within them. It performs the usual hostname and guardrail checks, looking for the path \"/etc/.../.kube.lan.lock/\" and exiting if present, or creating the directory if not. Then it uses a custom pull() function to download cURL from 85.214.149[.]236, and then uses cURL to reach out to iplogger[.]org/1A4Cu7 which is a logging and analytics site, and icanhazip.com to get the victim system's public IP address. Next, it saves the file at http://chimaera[.]cc/data/bot.txt as ~/.dockerd, and then installs and tests pnscan, jq and masscan, pulls the file libpcap.so from 85.214.149[.]236 and sets it as the environment variable LD_PRELOAD. This ensures that the libpcap library will be loaded into any future C programs compiled before any other libraries are loaded. Next, any existing file at \"/usr/bin/kuben2\" is deleted and the script is downloaded again using wget. Then, the IP ranges 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, 169.254.0.0/16, and \"100.64.0.0/10\" are scanned using masscan and the results are saved in \"/var/tmp/.out.txt\". Finally, kuben2 is run with each local IP identified, and finally \"/var/tmp/.out.txt\" is deleted and the bash history is cleared.<crlf>Kubernetes_scan_LAN_IPs.sh<crlf>This seems to be an incomplete or corrupted script. It performs the normal environment setup and discovery and the hostname check, with no actual functionality.<crlf>Docker-API.IP.Range.sh<crlf>This is another container-oriented infection script, targeting Docker this time. The comments are again in German, and the description translates to \"Infects all Docker containers of an x86_64 system with XmRig.The file /.dockerenv is replaced by XMRig and started'. As is typical, it checks if it has been run already on the target instance by looking for a hidden directory called \".docker-api.ip.range.lock\" and exits if so. If not, it makes this directory and then attempts to kill masscan, pnscan and zgrab if they are running. It will also check if jq, masscan, zgrab, pnscan, docker and cURL are installed, and download them from \"http://dl1.chimaera[.]cc:443/sugarcrm/themes/default/images/SugarLogic/...\" if not. Additionally, the files \"libpcap.so\", \"ca.pem\" and \"kuben2.sh\" are downloaded from \"http://chimaera[.]cc\" All of these utilities are installed and tested, the LD_PRELOAD environment variable is exported, and the file http://chimaera[.]cc/data/bot.txt is downloaded and saved as ~/.dockerd.<crlf>kuben2.sh<crlf>The following section in this script provides documentation on what the other scripts perform:<crlf>P1L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/Kubernetes.put.the.bot.sh\" # first touch payload<crlf>P2L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/MountSshExploit.sh\" # mount & breakout payload<crlf>P3L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/mo.sh\" # setup root pod miner<crlf>P4L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/Kubernetes.XMR.tmp.Setup.sh\" # setup temporr pod miner<crlf>P5L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/Kubernetes.put.the.bot.sh\" # install just the bot payload<crlf>Kubernetes.XMR.tmp.Setup.sh<crlf>This is a simple script that downloads XMRig from http://chimaera[.]cc/bin/x86_64/xmrig and saves it as /tmp/xmrig, then runs it with the IP 15.236.100[.]141:10128 and a wallet address (captured in the \"Indicators of Compromise\" section below) specified. From the name, we can presume it was intended for use in Kubernetes pods, but could conceivably be run on almost any Linux-based system.",

The cloud defense impairment functions worked as intended, shutting down the agent and removing all related files. There was a systemctl service left for aegis but it was no longer running. From the Alibaba Cloud console side, the connection to the agent and thus monitoring of the EC2 instance was lost. The XMRig configuration and other files were created in the directory /usr/sbin/.configure. Originally, before the script was modified to not contact the actual TeamTNT infrastructure, XMRig was downloaded from the IP address 85.214.149.236. A new user home directory, \"hilde\", is also created with an authorized SSH keys file that's available in the same extracted files directory.

Specifically, it has the standard history control and clearing, file locking and permissions modification, DNS modification and package management update functions. It also installs XMRig and the bot at http://45.9.148[.182]//bin/bot_root/$C_hg_SYS and turns it into a rootkit that will persist across reboots if possible. Finally, it downloads the grabber.sh script and executes it.<crlf>Kubernetes_root_PayLoad_1.sh<crlf>This script has many of the same functions as GRABBAR_aws_cloud.sh for checking system variables, exiting depending on the hostname, and updating packages and DNS entries on the victim system. As usual, it checks the system architecture using the command uname -m and saves this as the variable $C_hg_SYS. Its primary function is downloading a script hosted at the URL \"http://85.214.149[.]236:443/sugarcrm/themes/default/images/SugarLogic/.../TNTb/$C_hg_SYS\" and saving it as \"/usr/bin/dockerd_env\".

It performs the usual hostname and guardrail checks, looking for the path \"/etc/.../.kube.lan.lock/\" and exiting if present, or creating the directory if not. Then it uses a custom pull() function to download cURL from 85.214.149[.]236, and then uses cURL to reach out to iplogger[.]org/1A4Cu7 which is a logging and analytics site, and icanhazip.com to get the victim system's public IP address.

Then it uses a custom pull() function to download cURL from 85.214.149[.]236, and then uses cURL to reach out to iplogger[.]org/1A4Cu7 which is a logging and analytics site, and icanhazip.com to get the victim system's public IP address. Next, it saves the file at http://chimaera[.]cc/data/bot.txt as ~/.dockerd, and then installs and tests pnscan, jq and masscan, pulls the file libpcap.so from 85.214.149[.]236 and sets it as the environment variable LD_PRELOAD. This ensures that the libpcap library will be loaded into any future C programs compiled before any other libraries are loaded. Next, any existing file at \"/usr/bin/kuben2\" is deleted and the script is downloaded again using wget.

To reduce the number of accounts with unnecessary permissions, don't use the account root user or provide users console access unless they need it and give high-privileged users the PowerUser policy rather than admin. It's also best practice to use role-based authentication with temporary tokens where possible. Require multi-factor authentication for all Identity and Access Management (IAM) users and the root user and implement automated static analysis of all source code to make sure no credentials are accidentally leaked as part of public code. Moving beyond IAM, AWS CloudTrail and GuardDuty should be enabled and Cisco Secure Cloud Analytics (SCA) should be integrated so that any adversaries that do get access to the target account will have their actions logged and alerted on. AWS CloudWatch can be configured to collect system logs and metrics from all Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances for both detection and forensic analysis in the event of an incident. This is particularly useful for cryptocurrency mining, as high CPU, GPU or storage utilization is a common sign of cryptomining. AWS Systems Manager can also be set up to provide a more secure, IAM-based way of accessing EC2 instances remotely, without requiring an open network port and key management infrastructure for SSH. Instances being created in new regions or anomalous autoscaling events are also always of concern."

                        "Cybercriminals who are outed by security researchers must update their tools in order to continue to operate successfully. As defenders, we can learn a lot from the updates made by these cybercriminals. The tools used by TeamTNT demonstrate that cybercriminals are increasingly comfortable attacking modern environments such as Docker, Kubernetes and public cloud providers, which have traditionally been avoided by other cybercriminals who have instead focused on on-premise or mobile environments. Successfully deploying malware in these modern environments requires cybercriminals to get creative when it comes to avoiding detection, as we can see from TeamTNT's efforts to disable cloud security services. Network defenders must also get creative when it comes to implementing new forms of detection and monitoring if we are to ensure the ongoing security of these systems.",

According to our intelligence partner, the malware author modified these tools after they became aware that security researchers published the previous version of their scripts. These scripts are primarily designed to target Amazon Web Services (AWS) but could also run in on-premise, container or other forms of Linux instances.<crlf>Besides the primary credential stealer scripts, there are several TeamTNT payloads focused on cryptocurrency mining, persistence and lateral movement using techniques such as discovering and deploying onto all Kubernetes pods in a local network. There is also a script with login credentials for the primary distribution server, and another with an API key that might provide remote access to a tmate shared terminal session. Some of the TeamTNT scripts even contain defense evasion functions focused on disabling Alibaba cloud security tools. The focus on compromising modern cloud environments sets TeamTNT apart from many of the other cybercriminals encountered by Cisco Talos.<crlf>This post describes the functionality of the various scripts provided, serving as a \"field guide\" of sorts for further analysis and provides centralized documentation for all indicators of compromise and other atomic intelligence attributes.

                        "Prevention<crlf>Standard AWS security best practices will help limit the threat from cryptominers and other threats by reducing access to credentials with the requisite permissions to install them. To reduce the number of accounts with unnecessary permissions, don't use the account root user or provide users console access unless they need it and give high-privileged users the PowerUser policy rather than admin. It's also best practice to use role-based authentication with temporary tokens where possible. Require multi-factor authentication for all Identity and Access Management (IAM) users and the root user and implement automated static analysis of all source code to make sure no credentials are accidentally leaked as part of public code. Moving beyond IAM, AWS CloudTrail and GuardDuty should be enabled and Cisco Secure Cloud Analytics (SCA) should be integrated so that any adversaries that do get access to the target account will have their actions logged and alerted on. AWS CloudWatch can be configured to collect system logs and metrics from all Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances for both detection and forensic analysis in the event of an incident. This is particularly useful for cryptocurrency mining, as high CPU, GPU or storage utilization is a common sign of cryptomining. AWS Systems Manager can also be set up to provide a more secure, IAM-based way of accessing EC2 instances remotely, without requiring an open network port and key management infrastructure for SSH. Instances being created in new regions or anomalous autoscaling events are also always of concern.",

It then will attempt to connect to root@127.0.0.1, echo a Base64-encoded version of the MoneroOcean script to the SSH terminal, decode it and run it. Next, it downloads the same MoneroOcean setup script from GitHub using cURL and tries to execute it again.<crlf>Kubernetes.LAN.IP.Range.sh<crlf>This script's primary purpose is scanning local IP address ranges and then deploying various miner payloads to any Kubernetes clusters or other instances within them. It performs the usual hostname and guardrail checks, looking for the path \"/etc/.../.kube.lan.lock/\" and exiting if present, or creating the directory if not. Then it uses a custom pull() function to download cURL from 85.214.149[.]236, and then uses cURL to reach out to iplogger[.]org/1A4Cu7 which is a logging and analytics site, and icanhazip.com to get the victim system's public IP address. Next, it saves the file at http://chimaera[.]cc/data/bot.txt as ~/.dockerd, and then installs and tests pnscan, jq and masscan, pulls the file libpcap.so from 85.214.149[.]236 and sets it as the environment variable LD_PRELOAD. This ensures that the libpcap library will be loaded into any future C programs compiled before any other libraries are loaded. Next, any existing file at \"/usr/bin/kuben2\" is deleted and the script is downloaded again using wget. Then, the IP ranges 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, 169.254.0.0/16, and \"100.64.0.0/10\" are scanned using masscan and the results are saved in \"/var/tmp/.out.txt\". Finally, kuben2 is run with each local IP identified, and finally \"/var/tmp/.out.txt\" is deleted and the bash history is cleared.<crlf>Kubernetes_scan_LAN_IPs.sh<crlf>This seems to be an incomplete or corrupted script. It performs the normal environment setup and discovery and the hostname check, with no actual functionality.<crlf>Docker-API.IP.Range.sh<crlf>This is another container-oriented infection script, targeting Docker this time. The comments are again in German, and the description translates to \"Infects all Docker containers of an x86_64 system with XmRig.The file /.dockerenv is replaced by XMRig and started'. As is typical, it checks if it has been run already on the target instance by looking for a hidden directory called \".docker-api.ip.range.lock\" and exits if so. If not, it makes this directory and then attempts to kill masscan, pnscan and zgrab if they are running. It will also check if jq, masscan, zgrab, pnscan, docker and cURL are installed, and download them from \"http://dl1.chimaera[.]cc:443/sugarcrm/themes/default/images/SugarLogic/...\" if not. Additionally, the files \"libpcap.so\", \"ca.pem\" and \"kuben2.sh\" are downloaded from \"http://chimaera[.]cc\" All of these utilities are installed and tested, the LD_PRELOAD environment variable is exported, and the file http://chimaera[.]cc/data/bot.txt is downloaded and saved as ~/.dockerd.<crlf>kuben2.sh<crlf>The following section in this script provides documentation on what the other scripts perform:<crlf>P1L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/Kubernetes.put.the.bot.sh\" # first touch payload<crlf>P2L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/MountSshExploit.sh\" # mount & breakout payload<crlf>P3L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/mo.sh\" # setup root pod miner<crlf>P4L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/Kubernetes.XMR.tmp.Setup.sh\" # setup temporr pod miner<crlf>P5L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/Kubernetes.put.the.bot.sh\" # install just the bot payload<crlf>Kubernetes.XMR.tmp.Setup.sh<crlf>This is a simple script that downloads XMRig from http://chimaera[.]cc/bin/x86_64/xmrig and saves it as /tmp/xmrig, then runs it with the IP 15.236.100[.]141:10128 and a wallet address (captured in the \"Indicators of Compromise\" section below) specified.

Of course, the defense impairment techniques themselves can be detected. At a simplistic level, if monitoring agents such as aegis unexpectedly go offline, that is concerning.

The cloud defense impairment functions worked as intended, shutting down the agent and removing all related files. There was a systemctl service left for aegis but it was no longer running. From the Alibaba Cloud console side, the connection to the agent and thus monitoring of the EC2 instance was lost. The XMRig configuration and other files were created in the directory /usr/sbin/.configure. Originally, before the script was modified to not contact the actual TeamTNT infrastructure, XMRig was downloaded from the IP address 85.214.149.236.

It then will attempt to connect to root@127.0.0.1, echo a Base64-encoded version of the MoneroOcean script to the SSH terminal, decode it and run it. Next, it downloads the same MoneroOcean setup script from GitHub using cURL and tries to execute it again.<crlf>Kubernetes.LAN.IP.Range.sh<crlf>This script's primary purpose is scanning local IP address ranges and then deploying various miner payloads to any Kubernetes clusters or other instances within them. It performs the usual hostname and guardrail checks, looking for the path \"/etc/.../.kube.lan.lock/\" and exiting if present, or creating the directory if not. Then it uses a custom pull() function to download cURL from 85.214.149[.]236, and then uses cURL to reach out to iplogger[.]org/1A4Cu7 which is a logging and analytics site, and icanhazip.com to get the victim system's public IP address.

Next, it saves the file at http://chimaera[.]cc/data/bot.txt as ~/.dockerd, and then installs and tests pnscan, jq and masscan, pulls the file libpcap.so from 85.214.149[.]236 and sets it as the environment variable LD_PRELOAD. This ensures that the libpcap library will be loaded into any future C programs compiled before any other libraries are loaded. Next, any existing file at \"/usr/bin/kuben2\" is deleted and the script is downloaded again using wget. Then, the IP ranges 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, 169.254.0.0/16, and \"100.64.0.0/10\" are scanned using masscan and the results are saved in \"/var/tmp/.out.txt\". Finally, kuben2 is run with each local IP identified, and finally \"/var/tmp/.out.txt\" is deleted and the bash history is cleared.<crlf>Kubernetes_scan_LAN_IPs.sh<crlf>This seems to be an incomplete or corrupted script. It performs the normal environment setup and discovery and the hostname check, with no actual functionality.<crlf>Docker-API.IP.Range.sh<crlf>This is another container-oriented infection script, targeting Docker this time. The comments are again in German, and the description translates to \"Infects all Docker containers of an x86_64 system with XmRig.The file /.dockerenv is replaced by XMRig and started'. As is typical, it checks if it has been run already on the target instance by looking for a hidden directory called \".docker-api.ip.range.lock\" and exits if so. If not, it makes this directory and then attempts to kill masscan, pnscan and zgrab if they are running. It will also check if jq, masscan, zgrab, pnscan, docker and cURL are installed, and download them from \"http://dl1.chimaera[.]cc:443/sugarcrm/themes/default/images/SugarLogic/...\" if not. Additionally, the files \"libpcap.so\", \"ca.pem\" and \"kuben2.sh\" are downloaded from \"http://chimaera[.]cc\" All of these utilities are installed and tested, the LD_PRELOAD environment variable is exported, and the file http://chimaera[.]cc/data/bot.txt is downloaded and saved as ~/.dockerd.<crlf>kuben2.sh<crlf>The following section in this script provides documentation on what the other scripts perform:<crlf>P1L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/Kubernetes.put.the.bot.sh\" # first touch payload<crlf>P2L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/MountSshExploit.sh\" # mount & breakout payload<crlf>P3L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/mo.sh\" # setup root pod miner<crlf>P4L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/Kubernetes.XMR.tmp.Setup.sh\" # setup temporr pod miner<crlf>P5L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/Kubernetes.put.the.bot.sh\" # install just the bot payload<crlf>Kubernetes.XMR.tmp.Setup.sh<crlf>This is a simple script that downloads XMRig from http://chimaera[.]cc/bin/x86_64/xmrig and saves it as /tmp/xmrig, then runs it with the IP 15.236.100[.]141:10128 and a wallet address (captured in the \"Indicators of Compromise\" section below) specified. From the name, we can presume it was intended for use in Kubernetes pods, but could conceivably be run on almost any Linux-based system."

It then will attempt to connect to root@127.0.0.1, echo a Base64-encoded version of the MoneroOcean script to the SSH terminal, decode it and run it. Next, it downloads the same MoneroOcean setup script from GitHub using cURL and tries to execute it again.<crlf>Kubernetes.LAN.IP.Range.sh<crlf>This script's primary purpose is scanning local IP address ranges and then deploying various miner payloads to any Kubernetes clusters or other instances within them. It performs the usual hostname and guardrail checks, looking for the path \"/etc/.../.kube.lan.lock/\" and exiting if present, or creating the directory if not. Then it uses a custom pull() function to download cURL from 85.214.149[.]236, and then uses cURL to reach out to iplogger[.]org/1A4Cu7 which is a logging and analytics site, and icanhazip.com to get the victim system's public IP address. Next, it saves the file at http://chimaera[.]cc/data/bot.txt as ~/.dockerd, and then installs and tests pnscan, jq and masscan, pulls the file libpcap.so from 85.214.149[.]236 and sets it as the environment variable LD_PRELOAD. This ensures that the libpcap library will be loaded into any future C programs compiled before any other libraries are loaded. Next, any existing file at \"/usr/bin/kuben2\" is deleted and the script is downloaded again using wget. Then, the IP ranges 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, 169.254.0.0/16, and \"100.64.0.0/10\" are scanned using masscan and the results are saved in \"/var/tmp/.out.txt\". Finally, kuben2 is run with each local IP identified, and finally \"/var/tmp/.out.txt\" is deleted and the bash history is cleared.<crlf>Kubernetes_scan_LAN_IPs.sh<crlf>This seems to be an incomplete or corrupted script. It performs the normal environment setup and discovery and the hostname check, with no actual functionality.<crlf>Docker-API.IP.Range.sh<crlf>This is another container-oriented infection script, targeting Docker this time. The comments are again in German, and the description translates to \"Infects all Docker containers of an x86_64 system with XmRig.The file /.dockerenv is replaced by XMRig and started'. As is typical, it checks if it has been run already on the target instance by looking for a hidden directory called \".docker-api.ip.range.lock\" and exits if so. If not, it makes this directory and then attempts to kill masscan, pnscan and zgrab if they are running. It will also check if jq, masscan, zgrab, pnscan, docker and cURL are installed, and download them from \"http://dl1.chimaera[.]cc:443/sugarcrm/themes/default/images/SugarLogic/...\" if not. Additionally, the files \"libpcap.so\", \"ca.pem\" and \"kuben2.sh\" are downloaded from \"http://chimaera[.]cc\" All of these utilities are installed and tested, the LD_PRELOAD environment variable is exported, and the file http://chimaera[.]cc/data/bot.txt is downloaded and saved as ~/.dockerd.<crlf>kuben2.sh<crlf>The following section in this script provides documentation on what the other scripts perform:<crlf>P1L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/Kubernetes.put.the.bot.sh\" # first touch payload<crlf>P2L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/MountSshExploit.sh\" # mount & breakout payload<crlf>P3L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/mo.sh\" # setup root pod miner<crlf>P4L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/Kubernetes.XMR.tmp.Setup.sh\" # setup temporr pod miner<crlf>P5L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/Kubernetes.put.the.bot.sh\" # install just the bot payload<crlf>Kubernetes.XMR.tmp.Setup.sh<crlf>This is a simple script that downloads XMRig from http://chimaera[.]cc/bin/x86_64/xmrig and saves it as /tmp/xmrig, then runs it with the IP 15.236.100[.]141:10128 and a wallet address (captured in the \"Indicators of Compromise\" section below) specified. From the name, we can presume it was intended for use in Kubernetes pods, but could conceivably be run on almost any Linux-based system."

It then will attempt to connect to root@127.0.0.1, echo a Base64-encoded version of the MoneroOcean script to the SSH terminal, decode it and run it. Next, it downloads the same MoneroOcean setup script from GitHub using cURL and tries to execute it again.<crlf>Kubernetes.LAN.IP.Range.sh<crlf>This script's primary purpose is scanning local IP address ranges and then deploying various miner payloads to any Kubernetes clusters or other instances within them. It performs the usual hostname and guardrail checks, looking for the path \"/etc/.../.kube.lan.lock/\" and exiting if present, or creating the directory if not. Then it uses a custom pull() function to download cURL from 85.214.149[.]236, and then uses cURL to reach out to iplogger[.]org/1A4Cu7 which is a logging and analytics site, and icanhazip.com to get the victim system's public IP address. Next, it saves the file at http://chimaera[.]cc/data/bot.txt as ~/.dockerd, and then installs and tests pnscan, jq and masscan, pulls the file libpcap.so from 85.214.149[.]236 and sets it as the environment variable LD_PRELOAD. This ensures that the libpcap library will be loaded into any future C programs compiled before any other libraries are loaded. Next, any existing file at \"/usr/bin/kuben2\" is deleted and the script is downloaded again using wget. Then, the IP ranges 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, 169.254.0.0/16, and \"100.64.0.0/10\" are scanned using masscan and the results are saved in \"/var/tmp/.out.txt\". Finally, kuben2 is run with each local IP identified, and finally \"/var/tmp/.out.txt\" is deleted and the bash history is cleared.<crlf>Kubernetes_scan_LAN_IPs.sh<crlf>This seems to be an incomplete or corrupted script. It performs the normal environment setup and discovery and the hostname check, with no actual functionality.<crlf>Docker-API.IP.Range.sh<crlf>This is another container-oriented infection script, targeting Docker this time. The comments are again in German, and the description translates to \"Infects all Docker containers of an x86_64 system with XmRig.The file /.dockerenv is replaced by XMRig and started'. As is typical, it checks if it has been run already on the target instance by looking for a hidden directory called \".docker-api.ip.range.lock\" and exits if so. If not, it makes this directory and then attempts to kill masscan, pnscan and zgrab if they are running. It will also check if jq, masscan, zgrab, pnscan, docker and cURL are installed, and download them from \"http://dl1.chimaera[.]cc:443/sugarcrm/themes/default/images/SugarLogic/...\" if not. Additionally, the files \"libpcap.so\", \"ca.pem\" and \"kuben2.sh\" are downloaded from \"http://chimaera[.]cc\" All of these utilities are installed and tested, the LD_PRELOAD environment variable is exported, and the file http://chimaera[.]cc/data/bot.txt is downloaded and saved as ~/.dockerd.<crlf>kuben2.sh<crlf>The following section in this script provides documentation on what the other scripts perform:<crlf>P1L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/Kubernetes.put.the.bot.sh\" # first touch payload<crlf>P2L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/MountSshExploit.sh\" # mount & breakout payload<crlf>P3L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/mo.sh\" # setup root pod miner<crlf>P4L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/Kubernetes.XMR.tmp.Setup.sh\" # setup temporr pod miner<crlf>P5L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/Kubernetes.put.the.bot.sh\" # install just the bot payload<crlf>Kubernetes.XMR.tmp.Setup.sh<crlf>This is a simple script that downloads XMRig from http://chimaera[.]cc/bin/x86_64/xmrig and saves it as /tmp/xmrig, then runs it with the IP 15.236.100[.]141:10128 and a wallet address (captured in the \"Indicators of Compromise\" section below) specified. From the name, we can presume it was intended for use in Kubernetes pods, but could conceivably be run on almost any Linux-based system."

To reduce the number of accounts with unnecessary permissions, don't use the account root user or provide users console access unless they need it and give high-privileged users the PowerUser policy rather than admin. It's also best practice to use role-based authentication with temporary tokens where possible. Require multi-factor authentication for all Identity and Access Management (IAM) users and the root user and implement automated static analysis of all source code to make sure no credentials are accidentally leaked as part of public code. Moving beyond IAM, AWS CloudTrail and GuardDuty should be enabled and Cisco Secure Cloud Analytics (SCA) should be integrated so that any adversaries that do get access to the target account will have their actions logged and alerted on. AWS CloudWatch can be configured to collect system logs and metrics from all Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances for both detection and forensic analysis in the event of an incident. This is particularly useful for cryptocurrency mining, as high CPU, GPU or storage utilization is a common sign of cryptomining.

                        "After about five minutes, the VM showed up in Alibaba Cloud Security's \"Assets\" page as pictured above, and various vulnerability and configuration information could be assessed. Next, the TeamTNT script Kubernetes_root_payload_2.sh, which has been modified to send all network traffic to a Google Cloud VM rather than the actual TeamTNT server, was transferred to the target EC2 instance.<crlf>The script was run first without root privileges, which caused a large amount of permission denied errors for the removal of various files and directories, then with sudo. The cloud defense impairment functions worked as intended, shutting down the agent and removing all related files. There was a systemctl service left for aegis but it was no longer running. From the Alibaba Cloud console side, the connection to the agent and thus monitoring of the EC2 instance was lost. The XMRig configuration and other files were created in the directory /usr/sbin/.configure. Originally, before the script was modified to not contact the actual TeamTNT infrastructure, XMRig was downloaded from the IP address 85.214.149.236. A new user home directory, \"hilde\", is also created with an authorized SSH keys file that's available in the same extracted files directory.

Similarly, the sudden creation or expansion of an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume mounted to an EC2 instance to an unusual amount of utilized space may indicate a full blockchain has been downloaded, which some cryptominers perform. Of course, the defense impairment techniques themselves can be detected. At a simplistic level, if monitoring agents such as aegis unexpectedly go offline, that is concerning. Cisco Secure Cloud Analytics has a substantial amount of additional monitoring around various defense impairment techniques, but it is focused on AWS and Azure services not Alibaba Cloud Security.",
                        "Prevention<crlf>Standard AWS security best practices will help limit the threat from cryptominers and other threats by reducing access to credentials with the requisite permissions to install them. To reduce the number of accounts with unnecessary permissions, don't use the account root user or provide users console access unless they need it and give high-privileged users the PowerUser policy rather than admin. It's also best practice to use role-based authentication with temporary tokens where possible. Require multi-factor authentication for all Identity and Access Management (IAM) users and the root user and implement automated static analysis of all source code to make sure no credentials are accidentally leaked as part of public code. Moving beyond IAM, AWS CloudTrail and GuardDuty should be enabled and Cisco Secure Cloud Analytics (SCA) should be integrated so that any adversaries that do get access to the target account will have their actions logged and alerted on. AWS CloudWatch can be configured to collect system logs and metrics from all Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances for both detection and forensic analysis in the event of an incident. This is particularly useful for cryptocurrency mining, as high CPU, GPU or storage utilization is a common sign of cryptomining. AWS Systems Manager can also be set up to provide a more secure, IAM-based way of accessing EC2 instances remotely, without requiring an open network port and key management infrastructure for SSH. Instances being created in new regions or anomalous autoscaling events are also always of concern.",

Next, it saves the file at http://chimaera[.]cc/data/bot.txt as ~/.dockerd, and then installs and tests pnscan, jq and masscan, pulls the file libpcap.so from 85.214.149[.]236 and sets it as the environment variable LD_PRELOAD. This ensures that the libpcap library will be loaded into any future C programs compiled before any other libraries are loaded. Next, any existing file at \"/usr/bin/kuben2\" is deleted and the script is downloaded again using wget. Then, the IP ranges 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, 169.254.0.0/16, and \"100.64.0.0/10\" are scanned using masscan and the results are saved in \"/var/tmp/.out.txt\". Finally, kuben2 is run with each local IP identified, and finally \"/var/tmp/.out.txt\" is deleted and the bash history is cleared.<crlf>Kubernetes_scan_LAN_IPs.sh<crlf>This seems to be an incomplete or corrupted script. It performs the normal environment setup and discovery and the hostname check, with no actual functionality.<crlf>Docker-API.IP.Range.sh<crlf>This is another container-oriented infection script, targeting Docker this time. The comments are again in German, and the description translates to \"Infects all Docker containers of an x86_64 system with XmRig.The file /.dockerenv is replaced by XMRig and started'. As is typical, it checks if it has been run already on the target instance by looking for a hidden directory called \".docker-api.ip.range.lock\" and exits if so. If not, it makes this directory and then attempts to kill masscan, pnscan and zgrab if they are running. It will also check if jq, masscan, zgrab, pnscan, docker and cURL are installed, and download them from \"http://dl1.chimaera[.]cc:443/sugarcrm/themes/default/images/SugarLogic/...\" if not. Additionally, the files \"libpcap.so\", \"ca.pem\" and \"kuben2.sh\" are downloaded from \"http://chimaera[.]cc\" All of these utilities are installed and tested, the LD_PRELOAD environment variable is exported, and the file http://chimaera[.]cc/data/bot.txt is downloaded and saved as ~/.dockerd.<crlf>kuben2.sh<crlf>The following section in this script provides documentation on what the other scripts perform:<crlf>P1L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/Kubernetes.put.the.bot.sh\" # first touch payload<crlf>P2L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/MountSshExploit.sh\" # mount & breakout payload<crlf>P3L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/mo.sh\" # setup root pod miner<crlf>P4L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/Kubernetes.XMR.tmp.Setup.sh\" # setup temporr pod miner<crlf>P5L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/Kubernetes.put.the.bot.sh\" # install just the bot payload<crlf>Kubernetes.XMR.tmp.Setup.sh<crlf>This is a simple script that downloads XMRig from http://chimaera[.]cc/bin/x86_64/xmrig and saves it as /tmp/xmrig, then runs it with the IP 15.236.100[.]141:10128 and a wallet address (captured in the \"Indicators of Compromise\" section below) specified.

AWS Systems Manager can also be set up to provide a more secure, IAM-based way of accessing EC2 instances remotely, without requiring an open network port and key management infrastructure for SSH. Instances being created in new regions or anomalous autoscaling events are also always of concern.",

It performs the usual hostname and guardrail checks, looking for the path \"/etc/.../.kube.lan.lock/\" and exiting if present, or creating the directory if not. Then it uses a custom pull() function to download cURL from 85.214.149[.]236, and then uses cURL to reach out to iplogger[.]org/1A4Cu7 which is a logging and analytics site, and icanhazip.com to get the victim system's public IP address. Next, it saves the file at http://chimaera[.]cc/data/bot.txt as ~/.dockerd, and then installs and tests pnscan, jq and masscan, pulls the file libpcap.so from 85.214.149[.]236 and sets it as the environment variable LD_PRELOAD. This ensures that the libpcap library will be loaded into any future C programs compiled before any other libraries are loaded. Next, any existing file at \"/usr/bin/kuben2\" is deleted and the script is downloaded again using wget. Then, the IP ranges 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, 169.254.0.0/16, and \"100.64.0.0/10\" are scanned using masscan and the results are saved in \"/var/tmp/.out.txt\".

The comments are again in German, and the description translates to \"Infects all Docker containers of an x86_64 system with XmRig.The file /.dockerenv is replaced by XMRig and started'. As is typical, it checks if it has been run already on the target instance by looking for a hidden directory called \".docker-api.ip.range.lock\" and exits if so. If not, it makes this directory and then attempts to kill masscan, pnscan and zgrab if they are running. It will also check if jq, masscan, zgrab, pnscan, docker and cURL are installed, and download them from \"http://dl1.chimaera[.]cc:443/sugarcrm/themes/default/images/SugarLogic/...\" if not. Additionally, the files \"libpcap.so\", \"ca.pem\" and \"kuben2.sh\" are downloaded from \"http://chimaera[.]cc\" All of these utilities are installed and tested, the LD_PRELOAD environment variable is exported, and the file http://chimaera[.]cc/data/bot.txt is downloaded and saved as ~/.dockerd.<crlf>kuben2.sh<crlf>The following section in this script provides documentation on what the other scripts perform:<crlf>P1L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/Kubernetes.put.the.bot.sh\" # first touch payload<crlf>P2L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/MountSshExploit.sh\" # mount & breakout payload<crlf>P3L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/mo.sh\" # setup root pod miner<crlf>P4L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/Kubernetes.XMR.tmp.Setup.sh\" # setup temporr pod miner<crlf>P5L=\"http://chimaera[.]cc/sh/Kubernetes.put.the.bot.sh\" # install just the bot payload<crlf>Kubernetes.XMR.tmp.Setup.sh<crlf>This is a simple script that downloads XMRig from http://chimaera[.]cc/bin/x86_64/xmrig and saves it as /tmp/xmrig, then runs it with the IP 15.236.100[.]141:10128 and a wallet address (captured in the \"Indicators of Compromise\" section below) specified.

From the Alibaba Cloud console side, the connection to the agent and thus monitoring of the EC2 instance was lost.

Of course, the defense impairment techniques themselves can be detected. At a simplistic level, if monitoring agents such as aegis unexpectedly go offline, that is concerning.

Similarly, the sudden creation or expansion of an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume mounted to an EC2 instance to an unusual amount of utilized space may indicate a full blockchain has been downloaded, which some cryptominers perform. Of course, the defense impairment techniques themselves can be detected. At a simplistic level, if monitoring agents such as aegis unexpectedly go offline, that is concerning. Cisco Secure Cloud Analytics has a substantial amount of additional monitoring around various defense impairment techniques, but it is focused on AWS and Azure services not Alibaba Cloud Security.",
                        "Prevention<crlf>Standard AWS security best practices will help limit the threat from cryptominers and other threats by reducing access to credentials with the requisite permissions to install them. To reduce the number of accounts with unnecessary permissions, don't use the account root user or provide users console access unless they need it and give high-privileged users the PowerUser policy rather than admin. It's also best practice to use role-based authentication with temporary tokens where possible. Require multi-factor authentication for all Identity and Access Management (IAM) users and the root user and implement automated static analysis of all source code to make sure no credentials are accidentally leaked as part of public code. Moving beyond IAM, AWS CloudTrail and GuardDuty should be enabled and Cisco Secure Cloud Analytics (SCA) should be integrated so that any adversaries that do get access to the target account will have their actions logged and alerted on. AWS CloudWatch can be configured to collect system logs and metrics from all Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances for both detection and forensic analysis in the event of an incident. This is particularly useful for cryptocurrency mining, as high CPU, GPU or storage utilization is a common sign of cryptomining. AWS Systems Manager can also be set up to provide a more secure, IAM-based way of accessing EC2 instances remotely, without requiring an open network port and key management infrastructure for SSH. Instances being created in new regions or anomalous autoscaling events are also always of concern.",

                        "Prevention<crlf>Standard AWS security best practices will help limit the threat from cryptominers and other threats by reducing access to credentials with the requisite permissions to install them. To reduce the number of accounts with unnecessary permissions, don't use the account root user or provide users console access unless they need it and give high-privileged users the PowerUser policy rather than admin. It's also best practice to use role-based authentication with temporary tokens where possible. Require multi-factor authentication for all Identity and Access Management (IAM) users and the root user and implement automated static analysis of all source code to make sure no credentials are accidentally leaked as part of public code. Moving beyond IAM, AWS CloudTrail and GuardDuty should be enabled and Cisco Secure Cloud Analytics (SCA) should be integrated so that any adversaries that do get access to the target account will have their actions logged and alerted on. AWS CloudWatch can be configured to collect system logs and metrics from all Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances for both detection and forensic analysis in the event of an incident. This is particularly useful for cryptocurrency mining, as high CPU, GPU or storage utilization is a common sign of cryptomining. AWS Systems Manager can also be set up to provide a more secure, IAM-based way of accessing EC2 instances remotely, without requiring an open network port and key management infrastructure for SSH. Instances being created in new regions or anomalous autoscaling events are also always of concern.",

AWS Systems Manager can also be set up to provide a more secure, IAM-based way of accessing EC2 instances remotely, without requiring an open network port and key management infrastructure for SSH. Instances being created in new regions or anomalous autoscaling events are also always of concern."
