The campaign appears to be a continuation of Lazarus activity dubbed Operation Dream Job, which was first observed in August 2020. Symantec tracks this sub-set of Lazarus activity under the name Pompilus.</p>
<h2>Operation Dream Job</h2>
<p>Operation Dream Job involves Lazarus using fake job offers as a means of luring victims into clicking on malicious links or opening malicious attachments that eventually lead to the installation of malware used for espionage.</p>
<p>Past Dream Job campaigns have targeted individuals in the defense, government, and engineering sectors in activity observed in <a href="https://www.clearskysec.com/operation-dream-job/">August 2020</a> and <a href="https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/lazarus-campaign-ttps-and-evolution?utm_campaign=SED_2020_SES_Daily%20Threat%20Landscape%20Bulletin&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=139259470&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--J6q9LdfcxqEx5uWvbCzht0JfOc4OV82fEOolrbvnpLzo148HySiMyVKrAnXVeP8GIKLQKzgYM65wxMYUmNVksrBTEwg&amp;utm_content=139259470&amp;utm_source=hs_email">July 2021</a>.</p>
<h2>Recently targeted sectors</h2>
<p>In January 2022, Symantec detected attack activity on the networks of a number of organizations based in South Korea. The organizations were mainly in the chemical sector, with some being in the information technology (IT) sector. However, it is likely the IT targets were used as a means to gain access to chemical sector organizations.</p>
<p>There is sufficient evidence to suggest that this recent activity is a continuation of Operation Dream Job. That evidence includes file hashes, file names, and tools that were observed in previous Dream Job campaigns.</p>
<p>A typical attack begins when a malicious HTM file is received, likely as a malicious link in an email or downloaded from the web. The HTM file is copied to a DLL file called scskapplink.dll and injected into the legitimate system management software INISAFE Web EX Client.</p>
<p>The scskapplink.dll file is typically a signed Trojanized tool with malicious exports added. The attackers have been observed using the following signatures: DOCTER USA, INC and "A" MEDICAL OFFICE, PLLC</p>
<p>Next, scskapplink.dll downloads and executes an additional payload from a command-and-control (C&amp;C) server with the URL parameter key/values "prd_fld=racket".</p>
<p>This step kicks off a chain of shellcode loaders that download and execute arbitrary commands from the attackers, as well as additional malware, which are usually executed from malicious exports added to Trojanized tools such as the Tukaani project LZMA Utils library (XZ Utils).</p>
<p>The attackers move laterally on the network using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and inject into MagicLine by DreamSecurity on other machines.</p>
<p>In some instances, the attackers were spotted dumping credentials from the registry, installing a BAT file in a likely effort to gain persistence, and using a scheduled task configured to run as a specific user.</p>
<p>The attackers were also observed deploying post-compromise tools, including a tool used to take screenshots of web pages viewed on the compromised machine at set intervals (SiteShoter). They were also seen using an IP logging tool (IP Logger), a protocol used to turn computers on remotely (WakeOnLAN), a file and directory copier (FastCopy), and the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) executed under the MagicLine process.</p>
<h2>Case study</h2>
<p>The following is a case study detailing step-by-step attacker activity on an organization in the chemical sector.</p>
<p>January 17, 2022</p>
<p>00:51 – A malicious HTM file is received:</p>
<ul>
<li>e31af5131a095fbc884c56068e19b0c98636d95f93c257a0c829ec3f3cc8e4ba - csidl_profile\appdata\local\microsoft\windows\inetcache\ie\3tygrjkm\join_06[1].htm</li>
</ul>
<p>The HTM file is copied to a DLL file:</p>
<ul>
<li>rundll32.exe CSIDL_PROFILE\public\scskapplink.dll,netsetcookie Cnusrmgr</li>
</ul>
<p>This DLL file is injected into the legitimate system management software INISAFE Web EX Client. The file is a signed Trojanized version of the ComparePlus plugin for Notepad++ with malicious exports added.</p>
<p>01:02 – The file is run and downloads and executes a backdoor payload (final.cpl - 5f20cc6a6a82b940670a0f89eda5d68f091073091394c362bfcaf52145b058db) from a command-and-control (C&amp;C) server with the URL parameter key/values "prd_fld=racket".</p>
<p>The file final.cpl is a Trojanized version of the Tukaani project LZMA Utils library (XZ Utils) with a malicious export added (AppMgmt).</p>
<p>The malware connects to, downloads, decodes, and executes shellcode from the following remote location:</p>
<ul>
<li>hxxp[:]//happy[.]nanoace.co.kr/Content/rating/themes/krajee-fas/FrmAMEISMngWeb.asp</li>
</ul>
<p>01:04 – Another CPL file (61e305d6325b1ffb6de329f1eb5b3a6bcafa26c856861a8200d717df0dec48c4) is executed. This file, again, is a Trojanized version of LZMA Utils with a malicious added export.</p>
<p>01:13 – The shellcode loader (final.cpl) is executed again several times.</p>
<p>01:38 – Commands are executed to dump credentials from the SAM and SYSTEM registry hives.</p>
<p>Over the next several hours, the attackers run unknown shellcode via final.cpl at various intervals, likely to collect the dumped system hives, among other things.</p>
<p>06:41 – The attackers create a scheduled task to ensure persistence between system reboots:</p>
<ul>
<li>schtasks /create /RU Skynet.help\175287 /ST 15:42 /TR &amp;quot;cmd.exe /c C:\ProgramData\Intel\Intel.bat&amp;quot; /tn arm /sc MINUTE</li>
</ul>
<p>The scheduled task instructs the system to execute 'Intel.bat' as user ‘Skynet.help’ at 15:42 each day under the service name ‘arm’. It's unclear if this was an account that was cracked via the dumped registry hives or an account the attackers were able to create with admin rights.</p>
<p>The attackers were also observed installing Cryptodome (PyCrypto fork) Python encryption modules via CPL files.</p>
<p>A clean installation of BitDefender was also installed by the attackers. While unconfirmed, the threat actors may have installed an older version of this software (from 2020) with a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bitdefender-fixes-bug-allowing-attackers-to-run-commands-remotely/">vulnerability that allowed attackers to run arbitrary commands remotely</a>.</p>
<p>January 18</p>
<p>00:21 – The final.cpl file is executed again.</p>
<p>00:49 – A new CPL file called wpm.cpl (942489ce7dce87f7888322a0e56b5e3c3b0130e11f57b3879fbefc48351a78f6) is executed.</p>
<ul>
<li>CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\finaldata\wpm.cpl Thumbs.ini 4 30</li>
</ul>
<p>This file contains, and connects to, a list of IP addresses and records whether the connections were successful. </p>
<p>01:11 – Again, the final.cpl shellcode loader is executed multiple times, executing some unknown shellcode. This activity continued intermittently until 23:49.</p>
<p>23:49 – The file name of the CPL file changes to 'ntuser.dat'. The file location and command-line arguments remain the same.</p>
<p>January 19</p>
<p>00:24 – The CPL shellcode loader files (final.cpl and ntuser.dat) are executed multiple times.</p>
<p>00:28 – The attackers create a scheduled task on another machine, likely to ensure persistence:</p>
<ul>
<li>schtasks /create /RU SKYNET\i21076 /ST 09:28 /TR &amp;quot;cmd.exe /c C:\ProgramData\Adobe\arm.bat&amp;quot; /tn arm /sc MINUTE</li>
</ul>
<p>The command is used to run the file 'arm.bat' each day at 09:28 under the user account 'SKYNET' and the service name 'arm'.</p>
<p>00:29 – A file named arm.dat (48f3ead8477f3ef16da6b74dadc89661a231c82b96f3574c6b7ceb9c03468291) is executed with the following command line arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSIDL_SYSTEM\rundll32.exe CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\adobe\arm.dat,packageautoupdater LimitedSpatialExtent_U_f48182 -d 1440 -i 10 -q 8 -s 5</li>
</ul>
<p>The arm.dat file is a tool used to take screenshots of web pages viewed on the compromised machine every 10 seconds (SiteShoter), as determined by the command line arguments. The screenshots are saved in appdata\local with the date at the top of the file.</p>
<p>06:50 – The shellcode loader (final.cpl) is executed several times.</p>
<p>07:34 – A new CPL file named addins.cpl (5f20cc6a6a82b940670a0f89eda5d68f091073091394c362bfcaf52145b058db) is executed multiple times, which again is another shellcode loader and has the same command line arguments as seen with final.cpl:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSIDL_SYSTEM\rundll32.exe CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\addins.cpl, AppMgmt EO6-CRY-LS2-TRK3</li>
</ul>
<p>07:39 – A scheduled task is created:</p>
<ul>
<li>sc create uso start= auto binPath= “cmd.exe /c start /b C:\Programdata\addins.bat” DisplayName= uso</li>
</ul>
<p>The task is used to auto-start and execute addins.bat each time the system is booted. The task uses the service name 'uso' (a file name previously used in older Dream Job campaigns targeting security researchers).</p>
<p>The attacker runs addins.cpl again to run a command to start the service and then delete the service directly after:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSIDL_SYSTEM\rundll32.exe CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\addins.cpl, AppMgmt EO6-CRY-LS2-TRK3</li>
<li>sc start uso (via cmd.exe)</li>
<li>sc delete uso</li>
</ul>
<p>The following commands were then executed to collect information pertaining to network configuration, current user the attackers are logged in as, active users on the machine, available shared drives, and the contents of the 'addins' directory.</p>
<ul>
<li>ipconfig /all</li>
<li>whoami</li>
<li>query user</li>
<li>net use</li>
<li>dir CSIDL_WINDOWS\addins</li>
</ul>
<p>07:41 – The file addins.cpl is executed again multiple times before a scheduled task is created to run addins.bat again, start the service, and immediately delete the service:</p>
<ul>
<li>sc create uso start= auto binPath= &amp;quot;cmd.exe /c start /b C:\Windows\addins\addins.bat&amp;quot; DisplayName= uso</li>
<li>sc start uso</li>
<li>sc delete uso</li>
</ul>
<p>January 20</p>
<p>The attackers execute addins.cpl again with the same command line as before.</p>
<p>No further activity is observed.</p>
<p>The Lazarus group is likely targeting organizations in the chemical sector to obtain intellectual property to further North Korea’s own pursuits in this area. The group’s continuation of Operation Dream Job, as witnessed by Symantec <a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/countering-threats-north-korea/">and others</a>, suggests that the operation is sufficiently successful. As such, organizations should ensure they have adequate security in place and remain vigilant for attacks such as this.</p>
<p>As always, users should be wary of clicking links or downloading files even if they come from seemingly trustworthy sources.</p>
