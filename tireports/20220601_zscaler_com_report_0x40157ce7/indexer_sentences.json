Attackers are always looking for new techniques to bypass security measures and remain undetected by victims. In the past year, Browser-in-the Browser (BITB) attacks have emerged as a very effective technique for evading detection and convincing users to hand over credentials. Zscaler first observed a phishing campaign using this technique back in February of 2020. Early this year, an unaffiliated security researcher who goes by the handle mrd0x on Twitter, took to the social platform to share key technical details revealing how this technique takes advantage of third-party single sign-on (SSO) targeting brands like Apple, Microsoft, and Google. Most commonly, BITB attacks mimic single sign-on (SSO) windows with mostly undetectable fakes of the familiar log-in pop-ups."}

This layered phishing attack appears to be the first of its kind, delivering a pop-up window that states a victims browser is blocked due to repeated visits of pornographic websites prohibited by the Government of India. Attackers then prompt the victim with an extortion demand requiring them to enter a credit card and pay a fine to avoid being arrested by the police."}
