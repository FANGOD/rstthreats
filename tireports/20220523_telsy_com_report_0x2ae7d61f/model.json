This ensures that you always connect to a reliable network in public spaces and prevents hackers from accessing your data. Just remember to set a password to keep your access point private.<crlf>Avoid Unsecured Wi-Fi Hotspots: if you need to connect to a public network, try to avoid any access points marked Unsecure. Unsecured networks lack legitimate security features, and Evil Twin networks almost always have this designation. Hackers often rely on people brushing this off and connecting to their network without knowing the risks.<crlf>Disable Auto Connect: if you have auto connect enabled on your device, it will automatically connect to any networks that you have used before once youre in range. This can be dangerous in public places, especially if you have unknowingly connected to an Evil Twin network in the past. To ensure that you always connect to the network you want, disable auto connect any time you leave your home or office.<crlf>Never Log Into Private Accounts on Public Wi-Fi: you should avoid logging into private accounts whenever possible when using public Wi-Fi. Hackers can only access your login information if you use it while connected to their Evil Twin network, so remaining signed out can help protect your private information.<crlf>Use a VPN to Encrypt Traffic: a VPN can help protect you from an Evil Twin attack by encrypting your data before a hacker sees it. When you download a reliable VPN app to your device, it encrypts or scrambles your online activity before sending it to the network, making it impossible for a hacker to read and understand.<crlf>Stick to HTTPS websites: when using a public network, be sure to only visit HTTPS websites. These sites offer end-to-end encryption, preventing hackers from monitoring your activity while you use them.<crlf>Use Two-Factor Authentication: adding two-factor authentication to your private accounts is a great way to prevent hackers from accessing them. Even if a hacker gains access to your login credentials, the two-factor authentication will prevent them from successfully accessing your account.<crlf>What To Do if You Fall Victim to an Attack: if you discover that a hacker has breached your data through an Evil Twin attack, you should contact your local police department and your bank or credit card company if the hacker stole money or gained access to your banking information during the attack.",
