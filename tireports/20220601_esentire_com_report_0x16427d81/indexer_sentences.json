IcedID is a former banking-trojan, turned malware loader. On May 30th, eSentires research team, the Threat Response Unit (TRU), discovered that threat actors were trying to deploy IcedID onto a law firms IT network via an employees computer. eSentires Security Operations Centre (SOC) immediately isolated the infected endpoint, and worked with TRU to diagnose the malware as IcedID, after cleaning the endpoint and ensuring that the legal firms IT environment was clean and safe."}

In particular, TRU has seen IcedID deliver Cobalt Strike in under 20 minutes from the time of the IcedID infection, giving organizations little time to respond before the threat actors compromise their network. The introduction of an additional step in the attack chain could serve several purposes, from obscuring the final payload to utilizing more sophisticated Cobalt Strike builds that are associated with IcedID."}
