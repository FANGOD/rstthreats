                        "More notably, while VPNFilter and AcidRain work in very different ways, both binaries make use of the MEMGETINFO, MEMUNLOCK, and MEMERASE IOCTLS to erase mtd device files.",
                        "This plugin was brought to our attention initially by tlsh fuzzy hashing, a more recent matching library thats proven far more effective than ssdeep or imphash in identifying similar samples. The similarity was at 55% to AcidRain with no other samples being flagged in the VT corpus. This alone is not nearly enough to conclusively judge the two samples as tied, but it did warrant further investigation.",
                        "While we cannot definitively tie AcidRain to VPNFilter (or the larger Sandworm threat cluster), we note a medium-confidence assessment of non-trivial developmental similarities between their components and hope the research community will continue to contribute their findings in the spirit of collaboration that has permeated the threat intelligence industry over the past month.",
                        "They also appear to serve different purposes, with the VPNFilter plugin targeting specific devices with hardcoded paths, and AcidRain taking more of a one-binary-fits-all approach to wiping devices. By brute forcing device filenames, the attackers can more readily reuse AcidRain against more diverse targets.",
                        "AcidRains functionality is relatively straightforward and takes a bruteforce attempt that possibly signifies that the attackers were either unfamiliar with the particulars of the target firmware or wanted the tool to remain generic and reusable. The binary performs an in-depth wipe of the filesystem and various known storage device files. If the code is running as root, AcidRain performs an initial recursive overwrite and delete of non-standard files in the filesystem.",
                        "The reason we bring up the specter of VPNFilter is not because of its superficial similarities to AcidRain but rather because of an interesting (but inconclusive) code overlap between a specific VPNFilter plugin and AcidRain.",
                        "As we consider whats possibly the most important cyber attack in the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, there are many open questions. Despite Viasats statement claiming that there was no supply-chain attack or use of malicious code on the affected routers, we posit the more plausible hypothesis that the attackers deployed AcidRain (and perhaps other binaries and scripts) to these devices in order to conduct their operation.",
                        "On the left, AcidRain; on the right, VPNFilter",
                        "There are also notable differences between VPNFilters dstr plugin and AcidRain. The latter appears to be a far sloppier product that doesnt consistently rise to the coding standards of the former. For example, note the redundant use of process forking and needless repetition of operations.",
                        "VPNFilter and AcidRain are both notably similar and dissimilar. Theyre both MIPS ELF binaries and the bulk of their shared code appears to stem from statically-linked libc. It appears that they may also share a compiler, most clearly evidenced by the identical Section Headers Strings Tables.",
                        "Section Headers Strings Tables for VPNFilter and AcidRain",
                        "On Thursday, February 24th, 2022, a cyber attack rendered Viasat KA-SAT modems inoperable in Ukraine.<crlf>Spillover from this attack rendered 5,800 Enercon wind turbines in Germany unable to communicate for remote monitoring or control.<crlf>Viasats statement on Wednesday, March 30th, 2022 provides a somewhat plausible but incomplete description of the attack.<crlf>SentinelLabs researchers discovered new malware that we named AcidRain.<crlf>AcidRain is an ELF MIPS malware designed to wipe modems and routers.<crlf>We assess with medium-confidence that there are developmental similarities between AcidRain and a VPNFilter stage 3 destructive plugin.

                        "While we cannot definitively tie AcidRain to VPNFilter (or the larger Sandworm threat cluster), we note a medium-confidence assessment of non-trivial developmental similarities between their components and hope the research community will continue to contribute their findings in the spirit of collaboration that has permeated the threat intelligence industry over the past month.",
                        "They also appear to serve different purposes, with the VPNFilter plugin targeting specific devices with hardcoded paths, and AcidRain taking more of a one-binary-fits-all approach to wiping devices. By brute forcing device filenames, the attackers can more readily reuse AcidRain against more diverse targets.",
                        "After the initial discovery of VPNFilter, additional plugins were revealed by researchers attempting to understand the massive spread of the botnet and its many intricacies. Among these were previously unknown plugins, including dstr. As the mangled name suggests, its a destruction module meant to supplement stage 2 plugins that lacked the kill command meant to wipe the devices.",
                        "Despite what the Ukraine invasion has taught us, wiper malware is relatively rare. More so wiper malware aimed at routers, modems, or IoT devices. The most notable case is VPNFilter, a modular malware aimed at SOHO routers and QNAP storage devices, discovered by Talos. This was followed by an FBI indictment attributing the operation to Russia (APT28, in particular). More recently, the NSA and CISA attributed VPNFilter to Sandworm (a different threat actor attributed to the same organization, the Russian GRU) as the U.K.s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) described VPNFilters successor, Cyclops Blink.",
                        "The reason we bring up the specter of VPNFilter is not because of its superficial similarities to AcidRain but rather because of an interesting (but inconclusive) code overlap between a specific VPNFilter plugin and AcidRain.",

                        "VPNFilter and AcidRain are both notably similar and dissimilar. Theyre both MIPS ELF binaries and the bulk of their shared code appears to stem from statically-linked libc. It appears that they may also share a compiler, most clearly evidenced by the identical Section Headers Strings Tables.",

Some commentators have voiced a bizarre disappointment at the lack of cyber while those at the coalface are overwhelmed by the abundance of cyber operations accompanying conventional warfare.

These attacks are notable on their own. But theres been an elephant in the room by way of the rumored satellite modem hack. This particular attack goes beyond Ukraine."

Some commentators have voiced a bizarre disappointment at the lack of cyber while those at the coalface are overwhelmed by the abundance of cyber operations accompanying conventional warfare. From the beginning of 2022, we have dealt with six different strains of wiper malware targeting Ukraine: WhisperKill, WhisperGate, HermeticWiper, IsaacWiper, CaddyWiper, and DoubleZero. These attacks are notable on their own. But theres been an elephant in the room by way of the rumored satellite modem hack. This particular attack goes beyond Ukraine."

Then, the gradual disappearance of modems from the Viasat service. The actual service provider is in the midst of a complex arrangement where Eutalsat provides the service, but its administered by an Italian company called Skylogic as part of a transition plan.",
                        "The Russian invasion of Ukraine has included a wealth of cyber operations that have tested our collective assumptions about the role that cyber plays in modern warfare. Some commentators have voiced a bizarre disappointment at the lack of cyber while those at the coalface are overwhelmed by the abundance of cyber operations accompanying conventional warfare. From the beginning of 2022, we have dealt with six different strains of wiper malware targeting Ukraine: WhisperKill, WhisperGate, HermeticWiper, IsaacWiper, CaddyWiper, and DoubleZero. These attacks are notable on their own. But theres been an elephant in the room by way of the rumored satellite modem hack. This particular attack goes beyond Ukraine.",

This was followed by an FBI indictment attributing the operation to Russia (APT28, in particular). More recently, the NSA and CISA attributed VPNFilter to Sandworm (a different threat actor attributed to the same organization, the Russian GRU) as the U.K.s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) described VPNFilters successor, Cyclops Blink.",
                        "We first became aware of an issue with Viasat KA-SAT routers due to a reported outage of 5,800 Enercon wind turbines in Germany. To clarify, the wind turbines themselves were not rendered inoperable but remote monitoring and control of the wind turbines became unavailable due to issues with satellite communications. The timing coincided with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and suspicions arose that an attempt to take out Ukrainian military command-and-control capabilities by hindering satellite connectivity spilled over to affect German critical infrastructure. No technical details became available; technical speculation has been rampant.",
                        "As we consider whats possibly the most important cyber attack in the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, there are many open questions. Despite Viasats statement claiming that there was no supply-chain attack or use of malicious code on the affected routers, we posit the more plausible hypothesis that the attackers deployed AcidRain (and perhaps other binaries and scripts) to these devices in order to conduct their operation.",

We didnt know how to parse the name accurately. Possible interpretations include a shorthand for ukraine operation, the acronym for the Ukrainian Association of Patriots, or a Russian ethnic slur for Ukrainians . Only the incident responders in the Viasat case could say definitively whether this was in fact the malware used in this particular incident. We posit its use as a fitting hypothesis and will describe its functionality, quirky development traits, and possible overlaps with previous Russian operations in need of further research."

Some commentators have voiced a bizarre disappointment at the lack of cyber while those at the coalface are overwhelmed by the abundance of cyber operations accompanying conventional warfare. From the beginning of 2022, we have dealt with six different strains of wiper malware targeting Ukraine: WhisperKill, WhisperGate, HermeticWiper, IsaacWiper, CaddyWiper, and DoubleZero. These attacks are notable on their own. But theres been an elephant in the room by way of the rumored satellite modem hack. This particular attack goes beyond Ukraine.",
                        "Despite what the Ukraine invasion has taught us, wiper malware is relatively rare. More so wiper malware aimed at routers, modems, or IoT devices. The most notable case is VPNFilter, a modular malware aimed at SOHO routers and QNAP storage devices, discovered by Talos. This was followed by an FBI indictment attributing the operation to Russia (APT28, in particular). More recently, the NSA and CISA attributed VPNFilter to Sandworm (a different threat actor attributed to the same organization, the Russian GRU) as the U.K.s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) described VPNFilters successor, Cyclops Blink.",

Then, the gradual disappearance of modems from the Viasat service. The actual service provider is in the midst of a complex arrangement where Eutalsat provides the service, but its administered by an Italian company called Skylogic as part of a transition plan.",

                        "Despite what the Ukraine invasion has taught us, wiper malware is relatively rare. More so wiper malware aimed at routers, modems, or IoT devices. The most notable case is VPNFilter, a modular malware aimed at SOHO routers and QNAP storage devices, discovered by Talos. This was followed by an FBI indictment attributing the operation to Russia (APT28, in particular). More recently, the NSA and CISA attributed VPNFilter to Sandworm (a different threat actor attributed to the same organization, the Russian GRU) as the U.K.s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) described VPNFilters successor, Cyclops Blink.",

Scalable disruption is more plausibly achieved by pushing an update, script, or executable. Its also hard to envision how legitimate commands would enable either the DoS effects or render the devices unusable but not permanently bricked.",
                        "Viasat reports that the attackers exploited a misconfigured VPN appliance, gained access to the trust management segment of the KA-SAT network, moved laterally, then used their access to execute legitimate, targeted management commands on a large number of residential modems simultaneously. Viasat goes on to add that these destructive commands overwrote key data in flash memory on the modems, rendering the modems unable to access the network, but not permanently unusable.",
