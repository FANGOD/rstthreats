During an infection, the final loader payload typically downloads and executes a Cobalt Strike beacon to provide remote access for the threat actors, which, in a lot of cases, leads to ransomware being deployed to the victims machine.\nIn this initial post, we will unpack the different stages of a BAZARLOADER infection that comes in the form of an optical disk image (ISO) file. We will also dive into the obfuscation methods used by the main BAZARLOADER payload.\nTo follow along, you can grab the sample as well as the PCAP files for it on Malware-Traffic-Analysis.net.\nSHA256: 0900b4eb02bdcaefd21df169d21794c8c70bfbc68b2f0612861fcabc82f28149"
