                        "The Adobe.msi installer initially installs malware-related files to a subfolder in the users TEMP directory. Later, the malware copies itself from the TEMP directory to a working directory C:\\ProgramData\\PD, which is set as hidden to make sure users do not see it when they open the ProgramData folder in File Explorer. The malware is primarily written in Python, and comes with two different Python interpreters that also masquerade as executables related to Adobe, AdobeReaderUpdate.exe and ReaderSetting.exe. The malware sets up persistence via a scheduled task that runs every 5 minutes, pretending to be an update task for Adobe Reader named UpdateAdobeReader. The task executes the AdobeReaderUpdate script, a customized version of the open-source Loki.Rat which has been used by the El Machete APT group in an ongoing campaign since 2020.",
                        "El Machete APT:",
                        "In mid-March, El Machete was spotted sending spear-phishing emails to financial organizations in Nicaragua, with an attached Word document titled Dark plans of the neo-Nazi regime in Ukraine. The document contained an article written and published by Alexander Khokholikov, the Russian Ambassador to Nicaragua that discussed the Russo-Ukrainian conflict from the perspective of the Kremlin.",
                        "Although the specific email trap targeted a financial institution in Nicaragua, multiple artifacts suggest that this is part of a larger campaign, which is also targeting government entities in Venezuela. Judging by the activities that the actors perform in the infected networks, the purpose of the whole campaign is deemed a cyberespionage operation, consistent with the previously disclosed activity by the same attack group. This indicates that El Machete APT group continues to operate with slightly changing TTPs, even after researchers published technical descriptions and indicators of compromise for the malware used by the group.",

The groups activities have persisted throughout the years, adopting the practice of using government-themed documents as decoys, as well as using lures related to the current political situation."

In the past month while the Russian invasion of Ukraine was unfolding, Check Point Research (CPR) has observed advanced persistent threat (APT) groups around the world launching new campaigns, or quickly adapting ongoing ones to target victims with spear-phishing emails using the war as a lure. The attackers use decoys ranging from official-looking documents to news articles or even job postings, depending on the targets and region. Many of these lure documents utilize malicious macros or template injection to gain an initial foothold into the targeted organizations, and then launch malware attacks.<crlf>The use of the conflict as a bait is not limited to a specific region or APT group, it goes from Latin America to the Middle East and to Asia. In this article, CPR will provide an overview of several campaigns by different APT groups using the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war to increase the efficiency of their campaigns. CPR will discuss the victimology of these campaigns; the tactics used, and provide technical analysis of the observed malicious payloads and malware, specially crafted for this cyber-espionage. Below are the campaigns identified and profiled below",

Judging by the activities that the actors perform in the infected networks, the purpose of the whole campaign is deemed a cyberespionage operation, consistent with the previously disclosed activity by the same attack group. This indicates that El Machete APT group continues to operate with slightly changing TTPs, even after researchers published technical descriptions and indicators of compromise for the malware used by the group.",

The payload is written to the directory C:\\ProgramData\\ControlD\\, which it sets as a folder with system and hidden attributes.<crlf>Keylogger (TIME module) This is similar to the one that came with the Adobe.msi payload, but it never writes to disk. Instead, it posts the keylogger data directly to the C&C server.<crlf>BOX module This iterates over files in the system and uploads files of interest that are less than 5 MB, encoded as base64. The module first checks connectivity by opening a TCP socket to google.es. If the site is not accessible, the script exits.<crlf>Screenshot (LIST module) The module saves screenshots to -shopt.png inside a directory masquerading as Microsoft, namely %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\ControlDesktop\\. It then uploads the screenshot to the C&C server and proceeds to delete all PNG files in this directory. Similar to BOX, it initially checks that it can open a TCP socket to google.ru. If it fails, the script exits.<crlf>Clipboard stealer (SCAN module) Posts the data directly to the C&C server, without writing the data to disk.

The malware is primarily written in Python, and comes with two different Python interpreters that also masquerade as executables related to Adobe, AdobeReaderUpdate.exe and ReaderSetting.exe. The malware sets up persistence via a scheduled task that runs every 5 minutes, pretending to be an update task for Adobe Reader named UpdateAdobeReader. The task executes the AdobeReaderUpdate script, a customized version of the open-source Loki.Rat which has been used by the El Machete APT group in an ongoing campaign since 2020."

This page seemingly contains security-related content and discuses asymmetric encryption. However, embedded inside the BlogSpot page is another base64 string that contains the encoded C&C URL that the malware will eventually use. To find the relevant URL, the malware knows to search between two hardcoded strings that are 6-7 characters long. They tend to follow the pattern of /AAAA/ and *AAAA/, where the AAAA represents a 4-5-letter string."
