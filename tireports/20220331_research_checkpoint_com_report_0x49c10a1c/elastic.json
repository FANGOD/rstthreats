            "text": "Geopolitical tensions often make headlines and present a golden opportunity for threat actors to exploit the situation, especially those targeting high-profile victims. In the past month while the Russian invasion of Ukraine was unfolding, Check Point Research (CPR) has observed advanced persistent threat (APT) groups around the world launching new campaigns, or quickly adapting ongoing ones to target victims with spear-phishing emails using the war as a lure. The attackers use decoys ranging from official-looking documents to news articles or even job postings, depending on the targets and region. Many of these lure documents utilize malicious macros or template injection to gain an initial foothold into the targeted organizations, and then launch malware attacks.\nThe use of the conflict as a bait is not limited to a specific region or APT group, it goes from Latin America to the Middle East and to Asia. In this article, CPR will provide an overview of several campaigns by different APT groups using the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war to increase the efficiency of their campaigns. CPR will discuss the victimology of these campaigns; the tactics used, and provide technical analysis of the observed malicious payloads and malware, specially crafted for this cyber-espionage. Below are the campaigns identified and profiled below\nAPT Name\nAPT Origin\nTargeted Sector\nTargeted Countries\nEl Machete\nSpanish-speaking Country\nFinancial, Governmental\nNicaragua, Venezuela\nLyceum\nIran\nEnergy\nIsrael, Saudi Arabia\nSideWinder\nPossibly India\nUnknown\nPakistan",

The groups activities have persisted throughout the years, adopting the practice of using government-themed documents as decoys, as well as using lures related to the current political situation.\nIn mid-March, El Machete was spotted sending spear-phishing emails to financial organizations in Nicaragua, with an attached Word document titled Dark plans of the neo-Nazi regime in Ukraine. The document contained an article written and published by Alexander Khokholikov, the Russian Ambassador to Nicaragua that discussed the Russo-Ukrainian conflict from the perspective of the Kremlin.\nFigure 1 Lure document that contains an article about the Russia-Ukraine conflict, sent by El Machete APT to Nicaraguan financial institutions."

SideWinders malicious document, which also exploit the Russia-Ukraine conflict, was uploaded to VT in the middle of March. Judging by its content, the intended targets are Pakistani entities; the bait document contains the document of National Institute of Maritime Affairs of Bahria University in Islamabad, and is titled Focused talk on Russian Ukraine Conflict Impact on Pakistan.\nFigure 15 Decoy document related to Russia-Ukraine war, by Sidewinder APT.\nThis malicious document uses remote template injection. When its opened, the document retrieves a remote template from an actor-controlled server. The external template thats downloaded is an RTF file that exploits the CVE-2017-11882 (Equation Editor) vulnerability. When the vulnerability is exploited, it drops and executes 1.a package, that contains obfuscated JavaScript. The Sidewinder campaigns TTPs have not changed in the last few years, so we do not include exact technical details here, as they have been thoroughly described by multiple researchers.\nHowever, it is worth mentioning that a typical SideWinder APT payload is aaaaa .NET-based infostealer, originally called SystemApp.dll, and is capable of gathering system information, exfiltrating files from the infected machine and executing commands. The infostealer has been used with minor modifications in the groups espionage campaigns since early 2019."

            "text": "CPR shared a few examples of APT groups attempting to abuse the interest in the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. As some of these campaigns contain previously undisclosed technical details or updated malware, CPR researchers included Yara rules in the Appendix, which can assist with threat hunting for these APT campaigns and the tools they utilize.\nAlthough the attention of the public does not usually linger on a single issue for an extended period, the Russian-Ukrainian war is an obvious exception. This war affects multiple regions around the world and has potentially far-reaching ramifications. As a result, we can expect that APT threat actors will continue to use this crisis to conduct targeted phishing campaigns for espionage purposes."

            "text": "The malicious macro inside the document drops a base64-encoded file named ~djXsfwEFYETE.txt, uses the built-in certutil.exe to decode it to ~djXsfwEFYETE.vbe, an encoded VBScript file. The macro then launches the wscript.exe to execute the .vbe file, whose primary objective is to execute msiexec.exe with a remotely hosted .msi file titled Adobe.msi, which masquerades itself as Adobe software.\nFigure 2 Schema of the main components of the infection chain.\nThe Adobe.msi installer initially installs malware-related files to a subfolder in the users TEMP directory. Later, the malware copies itself from the TEMP directory to a working directory C:\\ProgramData\\PD, which is set as hidden to make sure users do not see it when they open the ProgramData folder in File Explorer. The malware is primarily written in Python, and comes with two different Python interpreters that also masquerade as executables related to Adobe, AdobeReaderUpdate.exe and ReaderSetting.exe. The malware sets up persistence via a scheduled task that runs every 5 minutes, pretending to be an update task for Adobe Reader named UpdateAdobeReader. The task executes the AdobeReaderUpdate script, a customized version of the open-source Loki.Rat which has been used by the El Machete APT group in an ongoing campaign since 2020.\nThe malicious Office document executes a macro code when the document is closed. The macro deobfuscates an executable embedded in the document and saves it to the %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\ directory. By using this method, the payload isnt executed directly by the Office document, but it will run the next time the computer is restarted.\nAs part of the wider Lyceum campaign, we also observed different executable droppers. These are executables bearing PDF icons, not documents:\nFigure 9 Two variants of Lyceum infection chain: lures related to the RU-UA conflict (top) and to Iran (bottom).\nAll the executables are written slightly differently but the main idea is the same: first, the dropper extracts a lure PDF file embedded as a resource and opens it, in the background and unnoticed by a victim, the dropper then downloads and executes the payload. We identified three categories of droppers:\n.NET DNS dropper Used to drop the .NET DNS backdoor (discussed later):\nFigure 10 The .NET dropper opens the decoy PDF and downloads the payload.\n.NET TCP Dropper Drops the .NET HTTP backdoor variant, and adds a scheduled task to run it.\nGolang Dropper Drops the Golang backdoor to the Startup folder and the Public\\Downloads folder. In addition, it drops a PDF file (a report about the Iranian cyber threat, similar to the other droppers) to the Public\\Downloads folder and executes it. After the PDF report is opened, the dropper finally executes the Golang backdoor from Public\\Downloads folder.\nFigure 11 Code snippet of the Golang dropper, which drops a Golang backdoor and a PDF report titled Iranian Cyber Threat.\nThe dropped files can be downloaded from the internet, or extracted from the dropper itself, depending on the sample."

            "text": "The malware does not have a hardcoded C&C server address. Instead, it relies on a file called license.dll, which contains a Base64-encoded URL to a BlogSpot webpage. This page seemingly contains security-related content and discuses asymmetric encryption. However, embedded inside the BlogSpot page is another base64 string that contains the encoded C&C URL that the malware will eventually use. To find the relevant URL, the malware knows to search between two hardcoded strings that are 6-7 characters long. They tend to follow the pattern of /AAAA/ and *AAAA/, where the AAAA represents a 4-5-letter string.\nFigure 3 BlogSpot page used by Adobe.msi. The C&C server is encoded between /noul/ and *noul/.\nThis method of retrieving the C&C servers has several advantages. Foremost, it easily allows the attacker to make the initial connection look innocuous by connecting to a subdomain of a known and seemingly benign server (blogspot.com). In addition, the attackers can switch C&C infrastructure very easily without having to redeploy new code to the victims machines.\nThe data is submitted to the C&C server in a somewhat obfuscated but consistent JSON format:\n{ \"nu8\": \"<hostname-username>\", \"d4\": \"<tag>\", \"r88\": \"<module name/data type>\", \"m77\": \"<file path>.pgp\", \"ns32\": \"<payload>\", \"submit\": \"submit\"}{\n\"nu8\": \"<hostname-username>\",\n\"d4\": \"<tag>\",\n\"r88\": \"<module name/data type>\",\n\"m77\": \"<file path>.pgp\",\n\"ns32\": \"<payload>\",\n\"submit\": \"submit\"\n}{\n\"nu8\": \"<hostname-username>\",\n\"d4\": \"<tag>\",\n\"r88\": \"<module name/data type>\",\n\"m77\": \"<file path>.pgp\",\n\"ns32\": \"<payload>\",\n\"submit\": \"submit\"\n}\nThe tag in the d4 field used by the Adobe malware is Utopiya_Nyusha_Maksim, which El Machete has used since 2020."

            "text": "The actors first send several commands to understand if the infected machine is interesting enough to proceed: these commands perform screenshots, keylogging, and listing files on the system. If deemed worthwhile, the actors execute a command to download and install another malware, JavaOracle.msi, via msiexec.exe.\nSimilar to Adobe.msi, JavaOracle.msi installs a Python-based malware and uses scheduled tasks for persistence. However, the Python scripts are not based on the Loki.Rat backdoor, although they offer some similar functionality through the modules placed in the directory Libs\\site-packages\\Java. The malware was observed launching multiple Python interpreters in parallel, each one running a different module. The Python executables are disguised as JavaHosts.exe, JavaExt.exe and JavaAdd.exe, and the actors also use these Python clones to check if a certain script/module is running, based on the process name. The modules include the following capabilities:\nDownload a payload from the C&C server (GAME module) The code implies that the payload is expected to be either a .exe or a .msi file. The payload is written to the directory C:\\ProgramData\\ControlD\\, which it sets as a folder with system and hidden attributes.\nKeylogger (TIME module) This is similar to the one that came with the Adobe.msi payload, but it never writes to disk. Instead, it posts the keylogger data directly to the C&C server.\nBOX module This iterates over files in the system and uploads files of interest that are less than 5 MB, encoded as base64. The module first checks connectivity by opening a TCP socket to google.es. If the site is not accessible, the script exits.\nScreenshot (LIST module) The module saves screenshots to -shopt.png inside a directory masquerading as Microsoft, namely %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\ControlDesktop\\. It then uploads the screenshot to the C&C server and proceeds to delete all PNG files in this directory. Similar to BOX, it initially checks that it can open a TCP socket to google.ru. If it fails, the script exits.\nClipboard stealer (SCAN module) Posts the data directly to the C&C server, without writing the data to disk. Before doing so, it checks that it can open a TCP connection to google.ru.\nThe malware from the JavaOracle.msi file seems to be using a new hardcoded tag, Foo_Fighters_Everlong. The timing appears to be coincidental, as the payload was first seen a few days before the news that Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins died.\nFigure 5 JavaOracle code steals the clipboard contents and posts the data to the C&C with a custom tag."

Judging by the activities that the actors perform in the infected networks, the purpose of the whole campaign is deemed a cyberespionage operation, consistent with the previously disclosed activity by the same attack group. This indicates that El Machete APT group continues to operate with slightly changing TTPs, even after researchers published technical descriptions and indicators of compromise for the malware used by the group."

            "text": "Each dropper bring its own type of payload. We observed the following backdoors deployed:\n.NET DNS Backdoor\nThe .NET DNS backdoor is a modified version of a tool called DnsDig, with code added to form frm1 that uses HeijdenDNS and DnsDig capabilities.\nFigure 12 Original DnsDig tool (left) vs Modified DnsDig (added frm1).\nThe backdoor uses DNS tunneling to communicate with its C&C server, and is able to download/upload files and execute commands.\n.NET TCP Backdoor\nThe backdoor communicates with the C&C using raw TCP sockets, and it implements its own communication protocol on top of this. Each sample contains a configuration that defines how it should communicate with the C&C, including separator characters, TCP ports and mapping of command types to numbers:\nFigure 13 Configuration snippet of the .NET TCP backdoor.\nAlthough the malware contains a configuration for the C&C communication, it still uses hardcoded values in the code itself, instead of the configuration constants. This indicates that the malware might still be under active development.\nThe capabilities of this backdoor include:\nExecute commands.\nTake screenshots.\nList files/directories.\nList installed applications.\nUpload/download/execute files.\nGolang HTTP Backdoor\nThe execution of the HTTP backdoor, written in Golang, consists of 3 stages, that occur in a loop:\nStage 1 Connectivity check. The malware generates a unique ID for the victim, based on the MD5 hash of the username. It then sends an empty HTTP POST request to the URI /GO/1.php of the C&C server. If the server responds with OK, the backdoor continues to the next stage.\nStage 2 Victim registration. In this step, the malware sends basic details of the victim in a POST request to the URI /GO/2.php, to register the victim in the attackers C&C server.\nStage 3 Commands retrieval and execution. First, the malware sends HTTP POST requests to the URI /GO/3.php to get commands for execution. Like the other backdoors we described, the backdoor supports commands that allow it to download/upload files and execute shell commands.\nFigure 14 Network traffic of the Golang HTTP backdoor, per execution stage"

Although these artifacts contain traps related to Iran, the other documents found on the relevant infrastructure suggest that the group might have used the baits related to the Russia-Ukraine war in Saudi Arabia as well, and probably in other countries in the region, which is the primary focus of the groups activities.\nAs well as the clear victimology, other indicators that suggest this activity is from the Lyceum APT group include:\nUse of Heijden.DNS open-source library, which was used by Lyceum in their previous attacks. This time, the actors did not obfuscate the library name but modified a tool named DnsDig that uses Heijden.DNS.\nDNS tunneling technique in the C&C communication widely used in previous Lyceum campaigns.\nOverlaps in the infrastructure, such as known Lyceum C&C servers hosted on the same ASN in the same networks with C&C from this campaign, and use of the same domain registrars such as Namecheap.\nUse of Protonmail email addresses to send the malicious email to their targets or to register the domains.\nJudging by the timestamps artifacts found and malicious domains registration, this specific campaign has been running for a few months. The adoption of more relevant lures and constant malware retooling suggests that theLyceum groupwill continue to conduct and adjust their espionage operations in the Middle East, despite public disclosures."
