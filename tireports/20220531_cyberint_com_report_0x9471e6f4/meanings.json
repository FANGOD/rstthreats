                        "Like other ransomware groups, the encryption phase consists of the iteration of all the files in the victims machine, excluding some files that are essential for the OS to keep operating, for example, the readme files, Recycle Bin, and the Desktop wallpaper Black Basta drop.",
                        "As 29 victims have already been added to Black Bastas victim list, the group is drawing the attention of security researchers and hunters in the cybersecurity community worldwide.",

                        "The assumption that Black Basta was related in any way is due to some similarities in the websites of the two groups. The Cyberint Research Team is not convinced these similarities are enough to determine that one group is connected to another. However, we cannot deny that some members might know each other from past experience, given the mutual origin of the groups.",

                        "The insider threat is becoming a legitimate delivery method ransomware groups use for two main reasons: The first is the convenience and how it makes things way easier for the group as they can deploy their ransomware and steal data without the hassle of infecting machines and escalating privileges while staying silent. The second is that although we dont have specific cases for which we know for sure a deal was made, the fact that many ransomware groups publicly announce they would like to bribe insiders to let them in means this method works, and it works well. As they try to lure insiders by leveraging their greed, Black Basta has been observed on several Darknet forums offering to buy access from organizations employees (Figure 3).",

Although the announcement regarding Black Basta seems very random in a post related to Peru, Conti stands behind this statement.",

                        "While malspam campaigns are still the most common method used by most ransomware groups, Black Basta included, the group looks for other leads on darknet forums.",
                        "These speculations became mainstream until a ransomware sample from February 17 (prior to the ContiLeaks incident), generating a ransom note with a group named no_name_software taking responsibility for the ransomware (Figure 10), was revealed.",
                        "Over the past month a new ransomware group, named Black Basta, has emerged and has quickly gained popularity.",
                        "As we reach the end of the first half of 2022, we have counted many new groups that were introduced to the ransomware industry. However, most of them vanish due to inconsistency in their campaigns or poor OpSec, which leads them to go off-grid fairly quickly after they are launched.",
                        "Like other ransomware groups, the encryption phase consists of the iteration of all the files in the victims machine, excluding some files that are essential for the OS to keep operating, for example, the readme files, Recycle Bin, and the Desktop wallpaper Black Basta drop.",
                        "The insider threat is becoming a legitimate delivery method ransomware groups use for two main reasons: The first is the convenience and how it makes things way easier for the group as they can deploy their ransomware and steal data without the hassle of infecting machines and escalating privileges while staying silent. The second is that although we dont have specific cases for which we know for sure a deal was made, the fact that many ransomware groups publicly announce they would like to bribe insiders to let them in means this method works, and it works well. As they try to lure insiders by leveraging their greed, Black Basta has been observed on several Darknet forums offering to buy access from organizations employees (Figure 3).",
                        "In the era of post-ContiLeaks ransomware groups are looking to utilize and base their product on the fairly successful Conti code. With several families recently emerging, the big question is whether we are witnessing the rise of another copycat, or is a Conti faction gaining its independence."
