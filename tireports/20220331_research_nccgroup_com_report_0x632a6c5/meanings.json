                        "Despite the public disclosure of their arsenal, it appears that Conti operators continue their business as usual by proceeding to compromise networks, exfiltrating data and finally deploying their ransomware.

                        "As discussed earlier on, the average dwell time of a Conti compromise is heavily dependant on the initial access method. Those incidents that have involved ProxyShell and ProxyLogon, the time between initial access and lateral movement has been three six months. However once lateral movement is conducted, time to completing their objective is a matter of days.",

                        "Conti operator(s) managed to escalate their privileges by compromising and using different accounts that were found in the compromised host. The credentials compromised in multiple engagements was achieved by deploying tools such as Mimikatz.",
                        "Similar to many other threat actors, Conti operator(s) exfiltrate a large amount of data from the compromised network using the legitimate software Rclone. Rclone was configured to upload to either Mega cloud storage provider or to a threat actor controlled server. Soon after the data exfiltration, the threat actor(s) started the data encryption. In addition, we estimate that the average time between the lateral movement and encryption is five days.",
                        "Another Conti engagement saw no methods of persistence. However, a temporary service was created to execute Cobalt Strike. It is hypothesized that the threat actor planned to achieve their objective quickly and therefore used services for execution rather than persistence.",
                        "In February 2022, a Twitter account which uses the handle ContiLeaks, started to publicly release information for the operations of the cybercrime group behind the Conti ransomware. The leaked data included private conversations between members along with source code of various panels and tools (e.g. Team9 backdoor panel [1]). Furthermore, even though the leaks appeared to have a focus on the people behind the Conti operations, the leaked data confirmed (at least to the public domain) that the Conti operators are part of the group, which operates under the TheTrick ecosystem. For the past few months, there was a common misconception that Conti was a different entity."

                        "In February 2022, a Twitter account which uses the handle ContiLeaks, started to publicly release information for the operations of the cybercrime group behind the Conti ransomware. The leaked data included private conversations between members along with source code of various panels and tools (e.g. Team9 backdoor panel [1]). Furthermore, even though the leaks appeared to have a focus on the people behind the Conti operations, the leaked data confirmed (at least to the public domain) that the Conti operators are part of the group, which operates under the TheTrick ecosystem. For the past few months, there was a common misconception that Conti was a different entity."
