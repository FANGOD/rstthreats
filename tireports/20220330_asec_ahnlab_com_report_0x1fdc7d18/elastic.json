            "text": "The ASEC analysis team is using the ASEC automatic analysis system RAPIT to categorize and respond to known malware. This post will list weekly statistics collected from March 21st, 2022 (Monday) to March 27th, 2022 (Sunday).\nFor the main category, info-stealer ranked top with 75.4%, followed by RAT (Remote Administration Tool) with 16.7%, downloader with 4.8%, banking malware with 2.4%, ransomware with 0.8%.\nTop 1 AgentTesla\nAgentTesla ranked first place with 25.4%. It is an info-stealer that leaks user credentials saved in web browsers, emails, and FTP clients.\nRecently collected samples use the following email servers and user accounts when leaking the collected information.\nserver : mail.contrivekota[.]in sender : info1@contrivekota[.]in receiver : hokota@contrivekota[.]in user : info1@contrivekota[.]in pw : Contr****23$\nserver : mail.atifnazar[.]com sender : yasir@atifnazar[.]com receiver : nelsonson202@gmail[.]com user : yasir@atifnazar[.]com pw : anazar@*****@\nserver : mail.alimentostolten[.]cl sender : moo7@alimentostolten[.]cl receiver : moo7@alimentostolten[.]cl user : moo7@alimentostolten[.]cl pw : icui4****@\nAs most are distributed through spam emails disguised as invoices, shipment documents, and purchase orders, the file names contain such words shown above (Invoice, Shipment, P.O. Purchase Order). Multiple collected samples were disguised as files with extensions of pdf and xlsx.\nBL7237207220.exe\nBukti-Transfer..exe\nFacturas Pagadas al Vencimiento Senders Name Confirming.bbvapdf.exe\nFEDEX Online Customer Advisory AWB BL Draft Commercial. Invoice 202005173534231972.pdf.exe\nGSC CONTRACT ORDER.exe\nInquiries_55MT.exe\nINV.0011040.2022.Img.exe\nRE TM 1200 203417 521.exe\nsolu.jpg.exe\nTop 2 Formbook\nFormbook is an infostealer that ranked second place with 20.2%.\nLike other info-stealer, it is mainly distributed through spam emails.

Besides user credentials in the web browser, the malware can steal various information through keylogging, clipboard grabbing, and web browser form grabbing.\nBelow is the list of confirmed C&C server URLs of Formbook.\nhxxp://www.abros88[.]com/46uq/\nhxxp://www.amenosu[.]com/b8eu/\nhxxp://www.arches2[.]com/qbkr/\nhxxp://www.budistx[.]com/s9m1/\nhxxp://www.cures8t[.]com/p9iu/\nhxxp://www.gunnipes[.]com/t90i/\nhxxp://www.plick-click[.]com/w6ot/\nhxxp://www.pordges[.]com/ok4e/\nTop 3 Lokibot\nLokibot ranked third place with 15.5%. It is an info-stealer that leaks information about programs such as web browsers, email clients, and FTP clients.\nBeing a malware that is distributed through spam emails, it shares similar file names with other malware spam emails.\n_ORD2697685.exe\nCopy_Of_Remittance.exe\nFEB INVOICES.exe\npersetujuan reeksport eks import sementara.pdf.exe\nPO #220321-2A.exe\nPO #220322-01A.exe\nPO 220324-0221A.exe\nAs shown below, most Lokibot C&C server URLs tend to end in fre.php.\nhxxp://furnaceshst[.]net/ge1/fre.php\nhxxp://furnaceshst[.]net/ge10/fre.php\nhxxp://furnaceshst[.]net/gd12/fre.php\nhxxp://mailsvr1[.]tk/BN1/fre.php\nhxxp://outlook-webpage-auth[.]ml/debsfletch/logs/fre.php\nhxxp://dlokis[.]xyz/cy/keke.php\nhxxp://sempersim[.]su/ge9/fre.php\nhxxp://vmopahtqdf84hfvsqepalcbcch63gdyvah[.]ml/BN2/fre.php\nTop 4 RedLine\nRedLine ranked fourth place with 8.3%. The malware steals various information such as web browsers, FTP clients, cryptocurrency wallets, and PC settings. It can also download additional malware by receiving commands from the C&C server. Like BeamWinHTTP, there have been numerous cases of RedLine being distributed under the disguise of a software crack file.\nThe following are the confirmed C&C server domains for RedLine:\n188.68.205[.]115:17645\n193.106.191[.]253:4752\n193.150.103[.]38:80\n194.87.109[.]41:4608\nbirja1[.]com:80\nTop 5 SnakeKeylogger\nTaking fifth place with 6.7%, SnakeKeylogger is an info-stealer type malware that leaks information such as user key inputs, system clipboards, and browser account information.\nLike AgentTesla, this malware uses e-mail servers and user accounts when leaking collected information.
