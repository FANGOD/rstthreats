            "text": "A Chinese state-backed advanced persistent threat (APT) group is attacking organizations around the globe in a likely espionage campaign that has been ongoing for several months.\nVictims in this Cicada (aka APT10) campaign include government, legal, religious, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in multiple countries around the world, including in Europe, Asia, and North America. The wide number of sectors and geographies of the organizations targeted in this campaign is interesting. Cicadas initial activity several years ago was heavily focused on Japanese-linked companies, though in more recent times it has been linked to attacks on managed service providers (MSPs) with a more global footprint. However, this campaign does appear to indicate a further widening of Cicadas targeting.\nThe attribution of this activity to Cicada is based on the presence on victim networks of a custom loader and custom malware that are believed to be exclusively used by the APT group.\nWhile Cicada has been linked to espionage-style operations dating back to 2009, the earliest activity in this current campaign occurred in mid-2021, with the most recent activity seen in February 2022, so this is a long-running attack campaign that may still be ongoing, researchers from Symantec, a division of Broadcom, have found."

            "text": "In several cases, the initial activity on victim networks is seen on Microsoft Exchange Servers, suggesting the possibility that a known, unpatched vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange may have been used to gain access to victim networks in some cases.\nOnce the attackers have successfully gained access to victim machines we observe them deploying various different tools, including a custom loader and the Sodamaster backdoor. The loader deployed in this campaign was also deployed in a previous Cicada attack.\nSodamaster is a known Cicada tool that is believed to be exclusively used by this group. It is a fileless malware that is capable of multiple functions, including evading detection in a sandbox by checking for a registry key or delaying execution; enumerating the username, hostname, and operating system of targeted systems; searching for running processes, and downloading and executing additional payloads. It is also capable of obfuscating and encrypting traffic that it sends back to its command-and-control (C&C) server. It is a powerful backdoor that Cicada has been using since at least 2020.\nIn this campaign, the attackers are also seen dumping credentials, including by using a custom Mimikatz loader. This version of Mimikatz drops mimilib.dll to obtain credentials in plain text for any user that is accessing the compromised host and provides persistence across reboots.\nThe attackers also exploit the legitimate VLC Media Player by launching a custom loader via the VLC Exports function, and use the WinVNC tool for remote control of victim machines.\nOther tools utilized in this attack campaign include:\nRAR archiving tool - can be used to compress, encrypt, or archive files, likely for exfiltration.\nSystem/Network discovery - a way for attackers to determine what systems or services are connected to an infected machine.\nWMIExec - Microsoft command-line tool that can be used to execute commands on remote computers.\nNBTScan - an open-source tool that has been observed being used by APT groups to conduct internal reconnaissance within a compromised network."

There were also victims in the telecoms, legal, and pharmaceutical sectors.\nThe victims are spread through a wide number of regions including the U.S., Canada, Hong Kong, Turkey, Israel, India, Montenegro, and Italy. There is also just one victim in Japan, which is notable due to Cicadas previous strong focus on Japanese-linked companies.\nThe attackers spent as long as nine months on the networks of some victims.\nThe victims targeted, the various tools deployed in this campaign, and what we know of Cicadas past activity all indicate that the most likely goal of this campaign is espionage. Cicada activity was linked by U.S. government officials to the Chinese government in 2018."
