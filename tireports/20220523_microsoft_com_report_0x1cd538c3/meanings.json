                        "Organizations should also complement best practices with a comprehensive security solution like Microsoft 365 Defender, which can detect and block skimming scripts on endpoints and servers by coordinating threat defense across various domains. Its also backed by threat experts whose continuous monitoring of the computing landscape for new attacker tools and techniques enriches our protection technologies. For example, in the case of Magecart, RiskIQ published a report that profiled the attacker groups behind it. Updates about the latest skimming campaigns observed are also provided.",
                        "Web skimming typically targets platforms like Magento, PrestaShop, and WordPress, which are popular choices for online shops because of their ease of use and portability with third-party plugins. Unfortunately, these platforms and plugins come with vulnerabilities that the attackers have constantly attempted to leverage. One notable web skimming campaign/group is Magecart, which gained media coverage over the years for affecting thousands of websites, including several popular brands.",
                        "As mentioned earlier, one notable skimming campaign is Magecart. First observed in 2010, Magecart campaigns have increased in number and become stealthier through heavy obfuscation techniques, new injection points, and delivery methods. In the last five years, popular organizations or brands have been affected by Magecartfrom an airline company and online ticketing services to a sports brand and personal transporter. In 2019, tens of thousands of websites got compromised because of a misconfiguration in the cloud service provider where these sites were hosted. Such an increase in these types of attacks prompted the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) to release a bulletin that warns users about the threat. In April 2022, PCI also released a major revision in its Data Security Standard (DSS), which now includes additional requirements for e-commerce environments to help prevent skimming."

                        "Microsoft security researchers recently observed that web skimming campaigns now employ various obfuscation techniques to deliver and hide skimming scripts. Its a shift from earlier tactics where attackers conspicuously injected malicious scripts into e-commerce platforms and content management systems (CMSs) via vulnerability exploitation, making this threat highly evasive to traditional security solutions. As of this writing, some of the latest skimming HTML and JavaScript files uploaded in VirusTotal have very low detection rates.",
                        "Below are Microsoft detections that detect malicious JavaScript skimmers in web servers.",
                        "In one of the campaigns weve observed, attackers obfuscated the skimming script by encoding it in PHP, which, in turn, was embedded inside an image filea likely attempt to leverage PHP calls when a websites index page is loaded. Recently, weve also seen compromised web applications injected with malicious JavaScript masquerading as Google Analytics and Meta Pixel (formerly Facebook Pixel) scripts. Some skimming scripts even had anti-debugging mechanisms, in that they first checked if the browsers developer tools were open.",
                        "Given the increasingly evasive tactics employed in skimming campaigns, organizations should ensure that their e-commerce platforms, CMSs, and installed plugins are up to date with the latest security patches and that they only download and use third-party plugins and services from trusted sources. They must also perform a regular and thorough check of their web assets for any compromised or suspicious content. Among the similarities we found in these recent skimming scripts include the presence of Base64-encoded strings such as checkout and onepage and the presence of the atob() JavaScript function in compromised pages. Such clues could help defenders surface these malicious scripts.",
                        "During our research, we came across two instances of malicious image files being uploaded to a Magento-hosted server. Both images contained a PHP script with a Base64-encoded JavaScript, and while they had identical JavaScript code, they slightly differed in their PHP implementation. The first image, disguised as a favicon (also known as a shortcut or URL icon), was available on VirusTotal, while the other one was a typical web image file discovered by our team. Their hashes are included in the section below.",
                        "This primary goal of web skimming campaigns is to harvest and later exfiltrate users payment information, such as credit card details, during checkout. To achieve this, attackers typically take advantage of vulnerabilities in e-commerce platforms and CMSs to gain access to pages they want to inject the skimming script into. Another common method is web-based supply chain attacks, where attackers use vulnerabilities in installed third-party plugins and themes or compromise ad networks that may inevitably serve malicious ads without the site owners knowledge or consent.",
                        "We also came across four lines of JavaScript injected into a compromised webpage. Like the malicious images we previously analyzed, the script in this scenario would run only when it finds the checkout keyword in the target web page URL. It would then fetch the skimming script hosted on an attacker-controlled domain to load a fake checkout form.",

Also, the malicious JavaScript they injected were very conspicuous. However, as the campaigns attack vectors and routines evolved, attackers also started using different techniques to hide their skimming scripts.",
                        "We first observed the malicious favicon in November 2021, when a few campaigns started dropping remote access trojans (RATs) on target web servers, in addition to injecting scripts into web pages. This delivery method moves away from the usual modus; it appears that attackers are now targeting the server side to inject their scripts, enabling them to bypass conventional browser protections like Content Security Policy (CSP), which prevents the loading of any external scripts. Meanwhile, the more recent image file was uploaded on the /media/wysiwyg/ directory, most likely by leveraging a vulnerability in the Magento CMS.",

                        "Given the increasingly evasive tactics employed in skimming campaigns, organizations should ensure that their e-commerce platforms, CMSs, and installed plugins are up to date with the latest security patches and that they only download and use third-party plugins and services from trusted sources. They must also perform a regular and thorough check of their web assets for any compromised or suspicious content. Among the similarities we found in these recent skimming scripts include the presence of Base64-encoded strings such as checkout and onepage and the presence of the atob() JavaScript function in compromised pages. Such clues could help defenders surface these malicious scripts.",
                        "In both images cases, once the embedded PHP script was run, it first retrieved the current pages URL and looked for the checkout and onepage keywords, both of which are mapped to Magentos checkout page.",

                        "This primary goal of web skimming campaigns is to harvest and later exfiltrate users payment information, such as credit card details, during checkout. To achieve this, attackers typically take advantage of vulnerabilities in e-commerce platforms and CMSs to gain access to pages they want to inject the skimming script into. Another common method is web-based supply chain attacks, where attackers use vulnerabilities in installed third-party plugins and themes or compromise ad networks that may inevitably serve malicious ads without the site owners knowledge or consent.",
                        "We also came across four lines of JavaScript injected into a compromised webpage. Like the malicious images we previously analyzed, the script in this scenario would run only when it finds the checkout keyword in the target web page URL. It would then fetch the skimming script hosted on an attacker-controlled domain to load a fake checkout form.",
                        "The boms() function (Figure 4) was responsible for creating and serving the fake checkout payment form (Figure 5) that collected target users payment details.",

                        "Meanwhile, online shoppers can protect themselves from web skimming attacks by ensuring their browser sessions are secure, especially during the checkout process. They should be wary of any unexpected or suspicious pop-ups that ask for payment details. Finally, users should turn on cloud-delivered protection and automatic sample submission on Microsoft Defender Antivirus (or a similar feature in their security product). This capability utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to quickly identify and stop new and unknown threats."

In the last five years, popular organizations or brands have been affected by Magecartfrom an airline company and online ticketing services to a sports brand and personal transporter. In 2019, tens of thousands of websites got compromised because of a misconfiguration in the cloud service provider where these sites were hosted. Such an increase in these types of attacks prompted the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) to release a bulletin that warns users about the threat. In April 2022, PCI also released a major revision in its Data Security Standard (DSS), which now includes additional requirements for e-commerce environments to help prevent skimming."
