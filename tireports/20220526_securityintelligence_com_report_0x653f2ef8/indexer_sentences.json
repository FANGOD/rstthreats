To date, this group has claimed attribution of 29 different victims across multiple industries using a double extortion strategy where the attackers not only execute ransomware but also steal data and threaten to release it publicly if the ransom demands are not met. The data disclosure element of these attacks takes place on a data leak site available on the Tor network. As a mechanism to apply pressure to coerce the victim to pay the ransom, the operators of Black Basta will gradually release stolen data on the leak site."}

However, the Conti group announced on May 12 that they had no affiliations with the Black Basta ransomware group. X-Forces assessment of the possible relationship between these groups is ongoing."}
