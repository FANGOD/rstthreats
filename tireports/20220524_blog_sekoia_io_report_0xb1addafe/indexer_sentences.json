The BALTDEFCOL has published studies about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has tweeted about an US Air Force War College delegation hosted during their European study trip on march 17. Later, on April 19, Chiefs of Defense from Estonia and Latvia, Lieutenant-General Herem and Lieutenant-General Kalni visited the Baltic Defense College. They both provided an overview of national defense concepts, highlighting priorities when preparing armed forces to face any threat for national sovereignty. These visits, and the strategic role BALTDEFCOL may have in Baltic military strategy against Russia, could be reasons for Turla targeting this institution for espionage purposes."}
