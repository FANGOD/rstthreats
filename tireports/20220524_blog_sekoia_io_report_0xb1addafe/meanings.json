                        "SEKOIA.IO Threat & Detection Research (TDR) Team have expanded the search on Russian-linked TURLAs infrastructures from a Googles TAG blog post. It exposes a reconnaissance and espionage campaign from the Turla intrusion set against the Baltic Defense College, the Austrian Economic Chamber which has a role in government decision-making such as economic sanctions and NATOs eLearning platform JDAL (Joint Advanced Distributed Learning) pointing Russian Intelligence interest for defense sector in Eastern Europe and for topics related to the economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.",
                        "On May 3rd 2022, Googles Threat Analysis Group (TAG) published a report Update on cyber activity in Eastern Europe exposing ongoing campaigns targeting Eastern Europe from various APT, Russian-linked APT28, TURLA, Callisto, Belarus-linked Ghostwriter and Curious Gorge, a group TAG attributes to Chinas Peoples Liberation Army Strategic Support Force (which is the space, cyber, and electronic warfare force and the 5th branch of Chinese Army).",
                        "This blog post on TURLA was originally published as a FLINT report (SEKOIA.IO Flash Intelligence) sent to our clients on May 11, 2022.",

                        "TURLA (aka Uroburos, Snake, Venomous Bear) is an historical Russian-speaking cyber espionage group widely believed to be operated by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB). The group is mainly known for targeting Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Defense organizations.Active since at least 1996, this intrusion set is suspected to have breached many US sensitive networks during a campaign dubbed Moonlight Maze from 1996 to 1999. In 2008 Turla is suspected to have used a USB worm dubbed Agent.BTZ to breach the US Department of Defense most sensitive networks.Tweet this!",
                        "The Austrian Federal Economic Chamber has an expanded function compared to other economic chambers in different countries which have a consultation purpose. By law, Austrian governments must consult with Chambers on legislative projects and important regulation, including economic sanctions. This involvement in decision-making and administrative procedures may be the reason for Russian espionage operations through Turlas phishing campaign, especially in a European country reputed to be a diplomatic bridge between occidental and russian side. Indeed, if Vienna officially supports Kiev, Austria wants to keep its neutral state, voted to reject sanctions against Russian oil and gas, and did not send weapons to Ukraine. Thus any change in the Austrian position could have an important effect on occidental unity facing Russian invasion of Ukraine, motivating an close monitoring from Moscow.",
                        "SEKOIA.IO researchers have expanded TURLAs infrastructures investigation through the domains in the TAG report:",
                        "Moreover, the attacker can grab the IP address of the victim which can be also an interesting selector to monitor the victims communications via TURLAs SIGINT capabilities.",
                        "The Baltic Defence College (BALTDEFCOL) is a center for strategic research established by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in 1999. It provides military education and conferences to high-rank officers from the founding states as well as allies like NATO, EU and other European countries including Ukraine. The BALTDEFCOL has published studies about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has tweeted about an US Air Force War College delegation hosted during their European study trip on march 17. Later, on April 19, Chiefs of Defense from Estonia and Latvia, Lieutenant-General Herem and Lieutenant-General Kalni visited the Baltic Defense College. They both provided an overview of national defense concepts, highlighting priorities when preparing armed forces to face any threat for national sovereignty. These visits, and the strategic role BALTDEFCOL may have in Baltic military strategy against Russia, could be reasons for Turla targeting this institution for espionage purposes."

It provides military education and conferences to high-rank officers from the founding states as well as allies like NATO, EU and other European countries including Ukraine. The BALTDEFCOL has published studies about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has tweeted about an US Air Force War College delegation hosted during their European study trip on march 17. Later, on April 19, Chiefs of Defense from Estonia and Latvia, Lieutenant-General Herem and Lieutenant-General Kalni visited the Baltic Defense College. They both provided an overview of national defense concepts, highlighting priorities when preparing armed forces to face any threat for national sovereignty. These visits, and the strategic role BALTDEFCOL may have in Baltic military strategy against Russia, could be reasons for Turla targeting this institution for espionage purposes."

                        "The Baltic Defence College (BALTDEFCOL) is a center for strategic research established by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in 1999. It provides military education and conferences to high-rank officers from the founding states as well as allies like NATO, EU and other European countries including Ukraine. The BALTDEFCOL has published studies about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has tweeted about an US Air Force War College delegation hosted during their European study trip on march 17. Later, on April 19, Chiefs of Defense from Estonia and Latvia, Lieutenant-General Herem and Lieutenant-General Kalni visited the Baltic Defense College. They both provided an overview of national defense concepts, highlighting priorities when preparing armed forces to face any threat for national sovereignty. These visits, and the strategic role BALTDEFCOL may have in Baltic military strategy against Russia, could be reasons for Turla targeting this institution for espionage purposes."

It provides military education and conferences to high-rank officers from the founding states as well as allies like NATO, EU and other European countries including Ukraine. The BALTDEFCOL has published studies about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has tweeted about an US Air Force War College delegation hosted during their European study trip on march 17. Later, on April 19, Chiefs of Defense from Estonia and Latvia, Lieutenant-General Herem and Lieutenant-General Kalni visited the Baltic Defense College. They both provided an overview of national defense concepts, highlighting priorities when preparing armed forces to face any threat for national sovereignty. These visits, and the strategic role BALTDEFCOL may have in Baltic military strategy against Russia, could be reasons for Turla targeting this institution for espionage purposes."

By law, Austrian governments must consult with Chambers on legislative projects and important regulation, including economic sanctions. This involvement in decision-making and administrative procedures may be the reason for Russian espionage operations through Turlas phishing campaign, especially in a European country reputed to be a diplomatic bridge between occidental and russian side. Indeed, if Vienna officially supports Kiev, Austria wants to keep its neutral state, voted to reject sanctions against Russian oil and gas, and did not send weapons to Ukraine. Thus any change in the Austrian position could have an important effect on occidental unity facing Russian invasion of Ukraine, motivating an close monitoring from Moscow."

It provides military education and conferences to high-rank officers from the founding states as well as allies like NATO, EU and other European countries including Ukraine. The BALTDEFCOL has published studies about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has tweeted about an US Air Force War College delegation hosted during their European study trip on march 17. Later, on April 19, Chiefs of Defense from Estonia and Latvia, Lieutenant-General Herem and Lieutenant-General Kalni visited the Baltic Defense College. They both provided an overview of national defense concepts, highlighting priorities when preparing armed forces to face any threat for national sovereignty. These visits, and the strategic role BALTDEFCOL may have in Baltic military strategy against Russia, could be reasons for Turla targeting this institution for espionage purposes."

The BALTDEFCOL has published studies about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has tweeted about an US Air Force War College delegation hosted during their European study trip on march 17. Later, on April 19, Chiefs of Defense from Estonia and Latvia, Lieutenant-General Herem and Lieutenant-General Kalni visited the Baltic Defense College. They both provided an overview of national defense concepts, highlighting priorities when preparing armed forces to face any threat for national sovereignty. These visits, and the strategic role BALTDEFCOL may have in Baltic military strategy against Russia, could be reasons for Turla targeting this institution for espionage purposes."

The BALTDEFCOL has published studies about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has tweeted about an US Air Force War College delegation hosted during their European study trip on march 17. Later, on April 19, Chiefs of Defense from Estonia and Latvia, Lieutenant-General Herem and Lieutenant-General Kalni visited the Baltic Defense College. They both provided an overview of national defense concepts, highlighting priorities when preparing armed forces to face any threat for national sovereignty. These visits, and the strategic role BALTDEFCOL may have in Baltic military strategy against Russia, could be reasons for Turla targeting this institution for espionage purposes."
