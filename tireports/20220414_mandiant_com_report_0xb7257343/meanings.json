                        "INCONTROLLER represents an exceptionally rare and dangerous cyber attack capability. It is comparable to TRITON, which attempted to disable an industrial safety system in 2017; INDUSTROYER, which caused a power outage in Ukraine in 2016; and STUXNET, which sabotaged the Iranian nuclear program around 2010. To help asset owners find and defend against INCONTROLLER, we have included a range of mitigations and discovery methods throughout this report. As future modifications to these tools are likely, we believe behavior-based hunting and detection methods will be most effective.",
                        "Figure 2: INCONTROLLER attack scenarios",
                        "We developed three cyber physical attack scenarios that highlight a range of possible outcomes from an attack using INCONTROLLER. In each of the three cases, TAGRUN could have been used at earlier stages to enumerate the victim environment, identify its targets, and learn about the physical process.",
                        "We are also tracking two additional tools affecting Windows-based systems that may be related to this threat activity. It is possible that these tools could be used to support the overall attack lifecycle in an INCONTROLLER attack by exploiting Windows-based systems in IT or operational technology (OT) environments.",
                        "INCONTROLLER's functionality is consistent with the malware used in Russia's prior cyber physical attacks. For example, the 2015 and 2016 Ukrainian blackouts both involved physical process manipulations combined with disruptive attacks against embedded devices. INCONTROLLER similarly allows the malware operator to manipulate physical processes, while also containing denial-of-service (DoS) capabilities to disrupt the availability of PLCs.",
                        "INCONTROLLER is comprised of three main components:",
                        "We believe INCONTROLLER is very likely linked to a state-sponsored group given the complexity of the malware, the expertise and resources that would be required to build it, and its limited utility in financially motivated operations. We are unable to associate INCONTROLLER with any previously tracked group at this stage of our analysis, but we note the activity is consistent with Russia's historical interest in ICS. While our evidence connecting INCONTROLLER to Russia is largely circumstantial, we note it given Russia's history of destructive cyber attacks, its current invasion of Ukraine, and related threats against Europe and North America.",
                        "The impact of these scenarios would depend on the nature of the victim facility and the extent of the attacker's understanding of and interaction with the controlled physical process. We note that our current understanding of INCONTROLLER is still limited given that it leverages an extensible structure that can support new features implemented by the author.",
                        "According to public vulnerability notices, Omron has previously identified other vulnerabilities that use the same or similar FIN ports that are used by OMSHELL. Omron's guidance for unpatched vulnerabilities, as noted in their security brief, indicates that external firewall filtering of identified FIN ports can be used as a mitigation. Mandiant believes that the recommended methodology may be a viable mitigation, though this mechanism has not been tested with INCONTROLLER. Additional guidance related to Omron's previous recommendations can be found in the related ICS Advisory for that older vulnerability.",
                        "It is feasible that each tool could be used independently, or the actor may use the three tools to attack a single environment. We highlight that the devices targeted by INCONTROLLER are often integrated in automation machinery (e.g., a milling machine or press) and could plausibly be present in a variety of industrial sectors and processes even without the user's explicit knowledge.",
                        "We have reason to believe that indicator-based detections would not be effective at detecting INCONTROLLER in victim environments, in part because the attacker would almost certainly modify or customize the tool prior to using it in a specific victim environment. Instead, defenders should focus their efforts on behavior-based hunting and detection methods for these tools.",
                        "In early 2022, Mandiant, in partnership with Schneider Electric, analyzed a set of novel industrial control system (ICS)-oriented attack toolswhich we call INCONTROLLER (aka PIPEDREAM)built to target machine automation devices. The tools can interact with specific industrial equipment embedded in different types of machinery leveraged across multiple industries. While the targeting of any operational environments using this toolset is unclear, the malware poses a critical risk to organizations leveraging the targeted equipment. INCONTROLLER is very likely state sponsored and contains capabilities related to disruption, sabotage, and potentially physical destruction.",
                        "INCONTROLLER includes three tools that enable the attacker to send instructions to ICS devices using industrial network protocols, such as OPC UA; Modbus; Codesys, which is used by EcoStruxure Machine Expert and SoMachine; and Omron FINS. While the tool's capabilities could enable the actor to communicate with a variety of products from different original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the actor developed modules for specific controllers from Schneider Electric and Omron. The targeted equipment consists of machine automation solutions whose use cases span from supporting simple, repetitive machines to complex modular machines in distributed architectures:",
                        "Figure 1: INCONTROLLER tooling overview",
                        "While the nature of any potential intended victims remains uncertain, INCONTROLLER poses a critical risk to organizations with compatible devices. The targeted devices are embedded in multiple types of machinery and could plausibly be present in many different industrial sectors. Given the consistencies with prior Russia-nexus threat activity, we suggest that INCONTROLLER poses the greatest threat to Ukraine, NATO member states, and other states actively responding to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Organizations should take immediate action to determine if the targeted ICS devices are present in their environments and begin applying vendor-specific countermeasures."

                        "INCONTROLLER represents an exceptionally rare and dangerous cyber attack capability. It is comparable to TRITON, which attempted to disable an industrial safety system in 2017; INDUSTROYER, which caused a power outage in Ukraine in 2016; and STUXNET, which sabotaged the Iranian nuclear program around 2010. To help asset owners find and defend against INCONTROLLER, we have included a range of mitigations and discovery methods throughout this report. As future modifications to these tools are likely, we believe behavior-based hunting and detection methods will be most effective."

                        "TAGRUN's capabilities, such as the ability to scan for and enumerate OPC UA servers, suggests a reconnaissance role. OPC acts as a central communications protocol to collect and store data from ICS assets in industrial environments. Access to this data can provide attackers with a detailed overview of production systems and control processes. The tool was likely developed for reconnaissance, but it can also write and change tag values, which could be used to modify data to either support an attack or mask process changes. TAGRUN also verifies whether the target environment is running a Windows operating system and provides different ping commands depending on this check's return value. This suggests that the actor may use non-Windows devices to execute TAGRUN.",
                        "We highly doubt that the threat actor would target these devices at random. It is more likely they were chosen because of reconnaissance into specific target environment(s). We note that this would be consistent with previous ICS malware, such as TRITON, which targeted a critical safety system that was almost certainly identified prior to compromising the target's industrial environment.",
                        "We believe INCONTROLLER is very likely linked to a state-sponsored group given the complexity of the malware, the expertise and resources that would be required to build it, and its limited utility in financially motivated operations. We are unable to associate INCONTROLLER with any previously tracked group at this stage of our analysis, but we note the activity is consistent with Russia's historical interest in ICS. While our evidence connecting INCONTROLLER to Russia is largely circumstantial, we note it given Russia's history of destructive cyber attacks, its current invasion of Ukraine, and related threats against Europe and North America.",

                        "According to public vulnerability notices, Omron has previously identified other vulnerabilities that use the same or similar FIN ports that are used by OMSHELL. Omron's guidance for unpatched vulnerabilities, as noted in their security brief, indicates that external firewall filtering of identified FIN ports can be used as a mitigation. Mandiant believes that the recommended methodology may be a viable mitigation, though this mechanism has not been tested with INCONTROLLER. Additional guidance related to Omron's previous recommendations can be found in the related ICS Advisory for that older vulnerability.",

While the tool's capabilities could enable the actor to communicate with a variety of products from different original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the actor developed modules for specific controllers from Schneider Electric and Omron.

The tools can interact with specific industrial equipment embedded in different types of machinery leveraged across multiple industries. While the targeting of any operational environments using this toolset is unclear, the malware poses a critical risk to organizations leveraging the targeted equipment. INCONTROLLER is very likely state sponsored and contains capabilities related to disruption, sabotage, and potentially physical destruction.",
                        "CODECALL communicates with ICS devices using the Modbus protocol, which potentially gives it the ability to interact with devices from different manufacturers. However, the tool contains a specific module to interact with, scan, and attack Schneider Electric's Modicon M251 (TM251MESE) PLC using Codesys, which is used by the company's proprietary EcoStruxure Machine Expert protocol. We have reason to believe the tool also targets Schneider Electric's Modicon M221 Nano PLC and the Modicon M258 PLC, and it potentially affects additional devices leveraging these protocols.",
                        "While the nature of any potential intended victims remains uncertain, INCONTROLLER poses a critical risk to organizations with compatible devices. The targeted devices are embedded in multiple types of machinery and could plausibly be present in many different industrial sectors. Given the consistencies with prior Russia-nexus threat activity, we suggest that INCONTROLLER poses the greatest threat to Ukraine, NATO member states, and other states actively responding to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Organizations should take immediate action to determine if the targeted ICS devices are present in their environments and begin applying vendor-specific countermeasures."

                        "CODECALL communicates with ICS devices using the Modbus protocol, which potentially gives it the ability to interact with devices from different manufacturers. However, the tool contains a specific module to interact with, scan, and attack Schneider Electric's Modicon M251 (TM251MESE) PLC using Codesys, which is used by the company's proprietary EcoStruxure Machine Expert protocol. We have reason to believe the tool also targets Schneider Electric's Modicon M221 Nano PLC and the Modicon M258 PLC, and it potentially affects additional devices leveraging these protocols.",
                        "TAGRUN's capabilities, such as the ability to scan for and enumerate OPC UA servers, suggests a reconnaissance role. OPC acts as a central communications protocol to collect and store data from ICS assets in industrial environments. Access to this data can provide attackers with a detailed overview of production systems and control processes. The tool was likely developed for reconnaissance, but it can also write and change tag values, which could be used to modify data to either support an attack or mask process changes. TAGRUN also verifies whether the target environment is running a Windows operating system and provides different ping commands depending on this check's return value. This suggests that the actor may use non-Windows devices to execute TAGRUN."

It is comparable to TRITON, which attempted to disable an industrial safety system in 2017; INDUSTROYER, which caused a power outage in Ukraine in 2016; and STUXNET, which sabotaged the Iranian nuclear program around 2010. To help asset owners find and defend against INCONTROLLER, we have included a range of mitigations and discovery methods throughout this report. As future modifications to these tools are likely, we believe behavior-based hunting and detection methods will be most effective.",
                        "We have reason to believe that indicator-based detections would not be effective at detecting INCONTROLLER in victim environments, in part because the attacker would almost certainly modify or customize the tool prior to using it in a specific victim environment. Instead, defenders should focus their efforts on behavior-based hunting and detection methods for these tools."
