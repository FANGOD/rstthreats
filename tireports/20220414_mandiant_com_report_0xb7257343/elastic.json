The tools can interact with specific industrial equipment embedded in different types of machinery leveraged across multiple industries. While the targeting of any operational environments using this toolset is unclear, the malware poses a critical risk to organizations leveraging the targeted equipment. INCONTROLLER is very likely state sponsored and contains capabilities related to disruption, sabotage, and potentially physical destruction.\nINCONTROLLER represents an exceptionally rare and dangerous cyber attack capability. It is comparable to TRITON, which attempted to disable an industrial safety system in 2017; INDUSTROYER, which caused a power outage in Ukraine in 2016; and STUXNET, which sabotaged the Iranian nuclear program around 2010. To help asset owners find and defend against INCONTROLLER, we have included a range of mitigations and discovery methods throughout this report. As future modifications to these tools are likely, we believe behavior-based hunting and detection methods will be most effective.\nIf you need support responding to related activity, please contact Mandiant Consulting. Further analysis of related threats is available as part of Mandiant Advantage Threat Intelligence.\nThis report is related to information shared in CISA Alert (AA22-103A).

            "text": "Industrial automation networks rely on a variety of equipment that enable operators to translate information and instructions into chains of physical actions. Given the diversity of assets present in industrial networks, industrial automation equipment typically speaks different languages across different portions of the network, which is possible using standardized industrial communication protocols.\nINCONTROLLER includes three tools that enable the attacker to send instructions to ICS devices using industrial network protocols, such as OPC UA; Modbus; Codesys, which is used by EcoStruxure Machine Expert and SoMachine; and Omron FINS. While the tool's capabilities could enable the actor to communicate with a variety of products from different original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the actor developed modules for specific controllers from Schneider Electric and Omron. The targeted equipment consists of machine automation solutions whose use cases span from supporting simple, repetitive machines to complex modular machines in distributed architectures:\nOPC servers\nSchneider Electric Modicon M251, Modicon M258, and Modicon M221 Nano PLCs Other devices leveraging Modbus and Codesys may also be affected\nOther devices leveraging Modbus and Codesys may also be affected\nOmron NX1P2 and NJ501 PLCs and R88D-1SN10F-ECT servo drive Other devices from NJ and NX PLC series may also be affected\nOther devices from NJ and NX PLC series may also be affected\nWe highly doubt that the threat actor would target these devices at random. It is more likely they were chosen because of reconnaissance into specific target environment(s). We note that this would be consistent with previous ICS malware, such as TRITON, which targeted a critical safety system that was almost certainly identified prior to compromising the target's industrial environment."

OPC acts as a central communications protocol to collect and store data from ICS assets in industrial environments. Access to this data can provide attackers with a detailed overview of production systems and control processes. The tool was likely developed for reconnaissance, but it can also write and change tag values, which could be used to modify data to either support an attack or mask process changes. TAGRUN also verifies whether the target environment is running a Windows operating system and provides different ping commands depending on this check's return value. This suggests that the actor may use non-Windows devices to execute TAGRUN.\nTAGRUNs capabilities include:\nScanning for OPC UA servers on a network\nReading the structure of OPC UA servers\nReading/writing tag values for data on an OPC UA server\nBrute forcing credentials\nOutputting log files\nSearch for and investigate irregular connections to OPC UA endpoints and enable robust audit logging for OPC UA applications. Aggregate OPC UA logs and audit records to a central location where applicable.\nReview OPC UA audit records for evidence of credential bruteforcing, nefarious certificate usage, irregular connection attempts, configuration changes, and changes to OPC tags.\nSearch for and investigate TAGRUN ping command execution.\nReview OT network traffic for evidence of pingsweep activity."

The tool primarily operates using the HTTP protocol, however it also utilizes Omron's proprietary FINS over UDP protocol for scanning and device identification. The framework is modular, which means the attacker can develop and deploy additional capabilities into the tool.\nOMSHELLs capabilities include:\nScanning for and identifying Omron devices on the network\nWiping the devices program memory and resetting the device\nLoading backup configuration and backup data from or restoring data to the device\nActivating the telnet daemon on the device\nConnecting to the device via the telnet daemon, uploading and optionally executing an arbitrary payload or command\nConnecting to a backdoor present on a device and providing arbitrary command execution\nPerforming a network traffic capture\nKilling arbitrary processes running on the device\nTransferring files to the device\nConnecting and communicating with attached servo drives\nWe have reason to believe that indicator-based detections would not be effective at detecting INCONTROLLER in victim environments, in part because the attacker would almost certainly modify or customize the tool prior to using it in a specific victim environment. Instead, defenders should focus their efforts on behavior-based hunting and detection methods for these tools.\nSearch for and investigate evidence of the creation/existence of OMSHELL-related host-based indicators on systems with access to OT resources and connectivity (e.g., packet captures).\nEnable robust logging for Omron PLC devices and aggregate logs to a central location where applicable.\nReview Omron device logs for evidence of the following activity: Activation of Telnet daemon on the device.

In each of the three cases, TAGRUN could have been used at earlier stages to enumerate the victim environment, identify its targets, and learn about the physical process.\nFigure 2: INCONTROLLER attack scenarios\nThe impact of these scenarios would depend on the nature of the victim facility and the extent of the attacker's understanding of and interaction with the controlled physical process.

We are unable to associate INCONTROLLER with any previously tracked group at this stage of our analysis, but we note the activity is consistent with Russia's historical interest in ICS. While our evidence connecting INCONTROLLER to Russia is largely circumstantial, we note it given Russia's history of destructive cyber attacks, its current invasion of Ukraine, and related threats against Europe and North America.\nSince at least 2014, Russia-nexus threat actors have targeted ICS assets and data with multiple ICS-tailored malware families (PEACEPIPE, BlackEnergy2, INDUSTROYER, TRITON, and VPNFILTER).\nFigure 3: Historical Russia-nexus activity impacting ICS\nINCONTROLLER's functionality is consistent with the malware used in Russia's prior cyber physical attacks. For example, the 2015 and 2016 Ukrainian blackouts both involved physical process manipulations combined with disruptive attacks against embedded devices. INCONTROLLER similarly allows the malware operator to manipulate physical processes, while also containing denial-of-service (DoS) capabilities to disrupt the availability of PLCs."
