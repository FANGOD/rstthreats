                                        <li>INCONTROLLER represents an exceptionally rare and dangerous cyber attack capability. It is comparable to TRITON, which attempted to disable an industrial safety system in 2017; INDUSTROYER, which caused a power outage in Ukraine in 2016; and STUXNET, which sabotaged the Iranian nuclear program around 2010. To help asset owners find and defend against INCONTROLLER, we have included a range of mitigations and discovery methods throughout this report. As future modifications to these tools are likely, we believe behavior-based hunting and detection methods will be most effective.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Figure 2: INCONTROLLER attack scenarios</li>
                                    
                                        <li>We developed three cyber physical attack scenarios that highlight a range of possible outcomes from an attack using INCONTROLLER. In each of the three cases, TAGRUN could have been used at earlier stages to enumerate the victim environment, identify its targets, and learn about the physical process.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>We are also tracking two additional tools affecting Windows-based systems that may be related to this threat activity. It is possible that these tools could be used to support the overall attack lifecycle in an INCONTROLLER attack by exploiting Windows-based systems in IT or operational technology (OT) environments.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>INCONTROLLER's functionality is consistent with the malware used in Russia's prior cyber physical attacks. For example, the 2015 and 2016 Ukrainian blackouts both involved physical process manipulations combined with disruptive attacks against embedded devices. INCONTROLLER similarly allows the malware operator to manipulate physical processes, while also containing denial-of-service (DoS) capabilities to disrupt the availability of PLCs.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>INCONTROLLER is comprised of three main components:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>We believe INCONTROLLER is very likely linked to a state-sponsored group given the complexity of the malware, the expertise and resources that would be required to build it, and its limited utility in financially motivated operations. We are unable to associate INCONTROLLER with any previously tracked group at this stage of our analysis, but we note the activity is consistent with Russia's historical interest in ICS. While our evidence connecting INCONTROLLER to Russia is largely circumstantial, we note it given Russia's history of destructive cyber attacks, its current invasion of Ukraine, and related threats against Europe and North America.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The impact of these scenarios would depend on the nature of the victim facility and the extent of the attacker's understanding of and interaction with the controlled physical process. We note that our current understanding of INCONTROLLER is still limited given that it leverages an extensible structure that can support new features implemented by the author.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>According to public vulnerability notices, Omron has previously identified other vulnerabilities that use the same or similar FIN ports that are used by OMSHELL. Omron's guidance for unpatched vulnerabilities, as noted in their security brief, indicates that external firewall filtering of identified FIN ports can be used as a mitigation. Mandiant believes that the recommended methodology may be a viable mitigation, though this mechanism has not been tested with INCONTROLLER. Additional guidance related to Omron's previous recommendations can be found in the related ICS Advisory for that older vulnerability.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>It is feasible that each tool could be used independently, or the actor may use the three tools to attack a single environment. We highlight that the devices targeted by INCONTROLLER are often integrated in automation machinery (e.g., a milling machine or press) and could plausibly be present in a variety of industrial sectors and processes even without the user's explicit knowledge.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>We have reason to believe that indicator-based detections would not be effective at detecting INCONTROLLER in victim environments, in part because the attacker would almost certainly modify or customize the tool prior to using it in a specific victim environment. Instead, defenders should focus their efforts on behavior-based hunting and detection methods for these tools.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>In early 2022, Mandiant, in partnership with Schneider Electric, analyzed a set of novel industrial control system (ICS)-oriented attack toolswhich we call INCONTROLLER (aka PIPEDREAM)built to target machine automation devices. The tools can interact with specific industrial equipment embedded in different types of machinery leveraged across multiple industries. While the targeting of any operational environments using this toolset is unclear, the malware poses a critical risk to organizations leveraging the targeted equipment. INCONTROLLER is very likely state sponsored and contains capabilities related to disruption, sabotage, and potentially physical destruction.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>INCONTROLLER includes three tools that enable the attacker to send instructions to ICS devices using industrial network protocols, such as OPC UA; Modbus; Codesys, which is used by EcoStruxure Machine Expert and SoMachine; and Omron FINS. While the tool's capabilities could enable the actor to communicate with a variety of products from different original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the actor developed modules for specific controllers from Schneider Electric and Omron. The targeted equipment consists of machine automation solutions whose use cases span from supporting simple, repetitive machines to complex modular machines in distributed architectures:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Figure 1: INCONTROLLER tooling overview</li>
                                    
                                        <li>While the nature of any potential intended victims remains uncertain, INCONTROLLER poses a critical risk to organizations with compatible devices. The targeted devices are embedded in multiple types of machinery and could plausibly be present in many different industrial sectors. Given the consistencies with prior Russia-nexus threat activity, we suggest that INCONTROLLER poses the greatest threat to Ukraine, NATO member states, and other states actively responding to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Organizations should take immediate action to determine if the targeted ICS devices are present in their environments and begin applying vendor-specific countermeasures.</li>

                                        <li>INCONTROLLER represents an exceptionally rare and dangerous cyber attack capability. It is comparable to TRITON, which attempted to disable an industrial safety system in 2017; INDUSTROYER, which caused a power outage in Ukraine in 2016; and STUXNET, which sabotaged the Iranian nuclear program around 2010. To help asset owners find and defend against INCONTROLLER, we have included a range of mitigations and discovery methods throughout this report.

We note that this would be consistent with previous ICS malware, such as TRITON, which targeted a critical safety system that was almost certainly identified prior to compromising the target's industrial environment.</li>

                                        <li>INCONTROLLER represents an exceptionally rare and dangerous cyber attack capability. It is comparable to TRITON, which attempted to disable an industrial safety system in 2017; INDUSTROYER, which caused a power outage in Ukraine in 2016; and STUXNET, which sabotaged the Iranian nuclear program around 2010. To help asset owners find and defend against INCONTROLLER, we have included a range of mitigations and discovery methods throughout this report. As future modifications to these tools are likely, we believe behavior-based hunting and detection methods will be most effective.</li>

                                <ul>
                                    
                                        <li>TAGRUN's capabilities, such as the ability to scan for and enumerate OPC UA servers, suggests a reconnaissance role. OPC acts as a central communications protocol to collect and store data from ICS assets in industrial environments. Access to this data can provide attackers with a detailed overview of production systems and control processes. The tool was likely developed for reconnaissance, but it can also write and change tag values, which could be used to modify data to either support an attack or mask process changes. TAGRUN also verifies whether the target environment is running a Windows operating system and provides different ping commands depending on this check's return value. This suggests that the actor may use non-Windows devices to execute TAGRUN.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>We highly doubt that the threat actor would target these devices at random. It is more likely they were chosen because of reconnaissance into specific target environment(s). We note that this would be consistent with previous ICS malware, such as TRITON, which targeted a critical safety system that was almost certainly identified prior to compromising the target's industrial environment.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>We believe INCONTROLLER is very likely linked to a state-sponsored group given the complexity of the malware, the expertise and resources that would be required to build it, and its limited utility in financially motivated operations. We are unable to associate INCONTROLLER with any previously tracked group at this stage of our analysis, but we note the activity is consistent with Russia's historical interest in ICS. While our evidence connecting INCONTROLLER to Russia is largely circumstantial, we note it given Russia's history of destructive cyber attacks, its current invasion of Ukraine, and related threats against Europe and North America.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Proper segmentation of IT and OT networks to aid in preventing attackers pivoting from corporate networks into industrial environments.<br/>Allow listing accepted primary/subordinate devices, behavior patterns, and commands to aid in establishing approved baselines and detecting anomalies with the aid of network monitoring.<br/>Implementation of an industrial firewall with deep packet inspection to aid in controlling access and approved capabilities.<br/>Implementation of ICS-aware intrusion protection systems to aid in monitoring for function codes from potentially malicious sources.<br/>Monitoring and blocking of external traffic to OPC UA ports, when possible, to aid in detecting anomalous traffic and prevent external network traffic directed at OPC UA-associated ports.<br/>Enabling and aggregating audit logs for OPC servers and clients.<br/>Periodic reviewing of audit logs for inconsistent or nefarious connections, security options negotiations, configuration changes, and user interaction.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>According to public vulnerability notices, Omron has previously identified other vulnerabilities that use the same or similar FIN ports that are used by OMSHELL. Omron's guidance for unpatched vulnerabilities, as noted in their security brief, indicates that external firewall filtering of identified FIN ports can be used as a mitigation. Mandiant believes that the recommended methodology may be a viable mitigation, though this mechanism has not been tested with INCONTROLLER. Additional guidance related to Omron's previous recommendations can be found in the related ICS Advisory for that older vulnerability.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Since at least 2014, Russia-nexus threat actors have targeted ICS assets and data with multiple ICS-tailored malware families (PEACEPIPE, BlackEnergy2, INDUSTROYER, TRITON, and VPNFILTER).</li>
                                    
                                        <li>INCONTROLLER includes three tools that enable the attacker to send instructions to ICS devices using industrial network protocols, such as OPC UA; Modbus; Codesys, which is used by EcoStruxure Machine Expert and SoMachine; and Omron FINS. While the tool's capabilities could enable the actor to communicate with a variety of products from different original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the actor developed modules for specific controllers from Schneider Electric and Omron. The targeted equipment consists of machine automation solutions whose use cases span from supporting simple, repetitive machines to complex modular machines in distributed architectures:</li>

                                        <li>In early 2022, Mandiant, in partnership with Schneider Electric, analyzed a set of novel industrial control system (ICS)-oriented attack toolswhich we call INCONTROLLER (aka PIPEDREAM)built to target machine automation devices. The tools can interact with specific industrial equipment embedded in different types of machinery leveraged across multiple industries. While the targeting of any operational environments using this toolset is unclear, the malware poses a critical risk to organizations leveraging the targeted equipment. INCONTROLLER is very likely state sponsored and contains capabilities related to disruption, sabotage, and potentially physical destruction.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>CODECALL communicates with ICS devices using the Modbus protocol, which potentially gives it the ability to interact with devices from different manufacturers. However, the tool contains a specific module to interact with, scan, and attack Schneider Electric's Modicon M251 (TM251MESE) PLC using Codesys, which is used by the company's proprietary EcoStruxure Machine Expert protocol. We have reason to believe the tool also targets Schneider Electric's Modicon M221 Nano PLC and the Modicon M258 PLC, and it potentially affects additional devices leveraging these protocols.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>While the nature of any potential intended victims remains uncertain, INCONTROLLER poses a critical risk to organizations with compatible devices. The targeted devices are embedded in multiple types of machinery and could plausibly be present in many different industrial sectors. Given the consistencies with prior Russia-nexus threat activity, we suggest that INCONTROLLER poses the greatest threat to Ukraine, NATO member states, and other states actively responding to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Organizations should take immediate action to determine if the targeted ICS devices are present in their environments and begin applying vendor-specific countermeasures.</li>

                                        <li>In early 2022, Mandiant, in partnership with Schneider Electric, analyzed a set of novel industrial control system (ICS)-oriented attack toolswhich we call INCONTROLLER (aka PIPEDREAM)built to target machine automation devices. The tools can interact with specific industrial equipment embedded in different types of machinery leveraged across multiple industries. While the targeting of any operational environments using this toolset is unclear, the malware poses a critical risk to organizations leveraging the targeted equipment. INCONTROLLER is very likely state sponsored and contains capabilities related to disruption, sabotage, and potentially physical destruction.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>INCONTROLLER includes three tools that enable the attacker to send instructions to ICS devices using industrial network protocols, such as OPC UA; Modbus; Codesys, which is used by EcoStruxure Machine Expert and SoMachine; and Omron FINS. While the tool's capabilities could enable the actor to communicate with a variety of products from different original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the actor developed modules for specific controllers from Schneider Electric and Omron. The targeted equipment consists of machine automation solutions whose use cases span from supporting simple, repetitive machines to complex modular machines in distributed architectures:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>This research was made possible thanks to the hard work of many people not listed on the byline. A huge thanks to the Schneider Electric Team, Mandiant Advanced Practices, FLARE, Consulting, Managed Defense, and everyone else who supported this effort.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>CODECALL communicates with ICS devices using the Modbus protocol, which potentially gives it the ability to interact with devices from different manufacturers. However, the tool contains a specific module to interact with, scan, and attack Schneider Electric's Modicon M251 (TM251MESE) PLC using Codesys, which is used by the company's proprietary EcoStruxure Machine Expert protocol. We have reason to believe the tool also targets Schneider Electric's Modicon M221 Nano PLC and the Modicon M258 PLC, and it potentially affects additional devices leveraging these protocols.</li>

We are unable to associate INCONTROLLER with any previously tracked group at this stage of our analysis, but we note the activity is consistent with Russia's historical interest in ICS. While our evidence connecting INCONTROLLER to Russia is largely circumstantial, we note it given Russia's history of destructive cyber attacks, its current invasion of Ukraine, and related threats against Europe and North America.</li>

                                        <li>Nathan Brubaker, Keith Lunden, Ken Proska, Muhammad Umair, Daniel Kapellmann Zafra, Corey Hildebrandt, Rob Caldwell<br/>Apr 13, 2022<br/><br/>15 mins read<br/><br/>Threat Research<br/>Threat Intelligence<br/>ICS<br/>Operational Technology<br/>Malware</li>
                                    
                                        <li>INCONTROLLER's functionality is consistent with the malware used in Russia's prior cyber physical attacks. For example, the 2015 and 2016 Ukrainian blackouts both involved physical process manipulations combined with disruptive attacks against embedded devices. INCONTROLLER similarly allows the malware operator to manipulate physical processes, while also containing denial-of-service (DoS) capabilities to disrupt the availability of PLCs.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>We believe INCONTROLLER is very likely linked to a state-sponsored group given the complexity of the malware, the expertise and resources that would be required to build it, and its limited utility in financially motivated operations. We are unable to associate INCONTROLLER with any previously tracked group at this stage of our analysis, but we note the activity is consistent with Russia's historical interest in ICS. While our evidence connecting INCONTROLLER to Russia is largely circumstantial, we note it given Russia's history of destructive cyber attacks, its current invasion of Ukraine, and related threats against Europe and North America.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>We recommend several steps to mitigate risk and counter malicious activity in environments using this protocol:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Proper segmentation of IT and OT networks to aid in preventing attackers pivoting from corporate networks into industrial environments.<br/>Allow listing accepted primary/subordinate devices, behavior patterns, and commands to aid in establishing approved baselines and detecting anomalies with the aid of network monitoring.<br/>Implementation of an industrial firewall with deep packet inspection to aid in controlling access and approved capabilities.<br/>Implementation of ICS-aware intrusion protection systems to aid in monitoring for function codes from potentially malicious sources.<br/>Monitoring and blocking of external traffic to OPC UA ports, when possible, to aid in detecting anomalous traffic and prevent external network traffic directed at OPC UA-associated ports.<br/>Enabling and aggregating audit logs for OPC servers and clients.<br/>Periodic reviewing of audit logs for inconsistent or nefarious connections, security options negotiations, configuration changes, and user interaction.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>In early 2022, Mandiant, in partnership with Schneider Electric, analyzed a set of novel industrial control system (ICS)-oriented attack toolswhich we call INCONTROLLER (aka PIPEDREAM)built to target machine automation devices. The tools can interact with specific industrial equipment embedded in different types of machinery leveraged across multiple industries. While the targeting of any operational environments using this toolset is unclear, the malware poses a critical risk to organizations leveraging the targeted equipment. INCONTROLLER is very likely state sponsored and contains capabilities related to disruption, sabotage, and potentially physical destruction.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Since at least 2014, Russia-nexus threat actors have targeted ICS assets and data with multiple ICS-tailored malware families (PEACEPIPE, BlackEnergy2, INDUSTROYER, TRITON, and VPNFILTER).</li>
                                    
                                        <li>We highly doubt that the threat actor would target these devices at random. It is more likely they were chosen because of reconnaissance into specific target environment(s). We note that this would be consistent with previous ICS malware, such as TRITON, which targeted a critical safety system that was almost certainly identified prior to compromising the target's industrial environment.</li>

                                        <li>CODECALL communicates with ICS devices using the Modbus protocol, which potentially gives it the ability to interact with devices from different manufacturers. However, the tool contains a specific module to interact with, scan, and attack Schneider Electric's Modicon M251 (TM251MESE) PLC using Codesys, which is used by the company's proprietary EcoStruxure Machine Expert protocol. We have reason to believe the tool also targets Schneider Electric's Modicon M221 Nano PLC and the Modicon M258 PLC, and it potentially affects additional devices leveraging these protocols.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>TAGRUN's capabilities, such as the ability to scan for and enumerate OPC UA servers, suggests a reconnaissance role. OPC acts as a central communications protocol to collect and store data from ICS assets in industrial environments. Access to this data can provide attackers with a detailed overview of production systems and control processes. The tool was likely developed for reconnaissance, but it can also write and change tag values, which could be used to modify data to either support an attack or mask process changes. TAGRUN also verifies whether the target environment is running a Windows operating system and provides different ping commands depending on this check's return value. This suggests that the actor may use non-Windows devices to execute TAGRUN.</li>

                                        <li>INCONTROLLER represents an exceptionally rare and dangerous cyber attack capability. It is comparable to TRITON, which attempted to disable an industrial safety system in 2017; INDUSTROYER, which caused a power outage in Ukraine in 2016; and STUXNET, which sabotaged the Iranian nuclear program around 2010. To help asset owners find and defend against INCONTROLLER, we have included a range of mitigations and discovery methods throughout this report. As future modifications to these tools are likely, we believe behavior-based hunting and detection methods will be most effective.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>We believe INCONTROLLER is very likely linked to a state-sponsored group given the complexity of the malware, the expertise and resources that would be required to build it, and its limited utility in financially motivated operations. We are unable to associate INCONTROLLER with any previously tracked group at this stage of our analysis, but we note the activity is consistent with Russia's historical interest in ICS. While our evidence connecting INCONTROLLER to Russia is largely circumstantial, we note it given Russia's history of destructive cyber attacks, its current invasion of Ukraine, and related threats against Europe and North America.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>While the nature of any potential intended victims remains uncertain, INCONTROLLER poses a critical risk to organizations with compatible devices. The targeted devices are embedded in multiple types of machinery and could plausibly be present in many different industrial sectors. Given the consistencies with prior Russia-nexus threat activity, we suggest that INCONTROLLER poses the greatest threat to Ukraine, NATO member states, and other states actively responding to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Organizations should take immediate action to determine if the targeted ICS devices are present in their environments and begin applying vendor-specific countermeasures.</li>

                                        <li>INCONTROLLER's functionality is consistent with the malware used in Russia's prior cyber physical attacks. For example, the 2015 and 2016 Ukrainian blackouts both involved physical process manipulations combined with disruptive attacks against embedded devices. INCONTROLLER similarly allows the malware operator to manipulate physical processes, while also containing denial-of-service (DoS) capabilities to disrupt the availability of PLCs.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>We believe INCONTROLLER is very likely linked to a state-sponsored group given the complexity of the malware, the expertise and resources that would be required to build it, and its limited utility in financially motivated operations. We are unable to associate INCONTROLLER with any previously tracked group at this stage of our analysis, but we note the activity is consistent with Russia's historical interest in ICS. While our evidence connecting INCONTROLLER to Russia is largely circumstantial, we note it given Russia's history of destructive cyber attacks, its current invasion of Ukraine, and related threats against Europe and North America.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>While the nature of any potential intended victims remains uncertain, INCONTROLLER poses a critical risk to organizations with compatible devices. The targeted devices are embedded in multiple types of machinery and could plausibly be present in many different industrial sectors. Given the consistencies with prior Russia-nexus threat activity, we suggest that INCONTROLLER poses the greatest threat to Ukraine, NATO member states, and other states actively responding to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Organizations should take immediate action to determine if the targeted ICS devices are present in their environments and begin applying vendor-specific countermeasures.</li>

                                        <li>In early 2022, Mandiant, in partnership with Schneider Electric, analyzed a set of novel industrial control system (ICS)-oriented attack toolswhich we call INCONTROLLER (aka PIPEDREAM)built to target machine automation devices. The tools can interact with specific industrial equipment embedded in different types of machinery leveraged across multiple industries. While the targeting of any operational environments using this toolset is unclear, the malware poses a critical risk to organizations leveraging the targeted equipment. INCONTROLLER is very likely state sponsored and contains capabilities related to disruption, sabotage, and potentially physical destruction.</li>

                                        <li>In early 2022, Mandiant, in partnership with Schneider Electric, analyzed a set of novel industrial control system (ICS)-oriented attack toolswhich we call INCONTROLLER (aka PIPEDREAM)built to target machine automation devices. The tools can interact with specific industrial equipment embedded in different types of machinery leveraged across multiple industries. While the targeting of any operational environments using this toolset is unclear, the malware poses a critical risk to organizations leveraging the targeted equipment. INCONTROLLER is very likely state sponsored and contains capabilities related to disruption, sabotage, and potentially physical destruction.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>INCONTROLLER includes three tools that enable the attacker to send instructions to ICS devices using industrial network protocols, such as OPC UA; Modbus; Codesys, which is used by EcoStruxure Machine Expert and SoMachine; and Omron FINS. While the tool's capabilities could enable the actor to communicate with a variety of products from different original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the actor developed modules for specific controllers from Schneider Electric and Omron. The targeted equipment consists of machine automation solutions whose use cases span from supporting simple, repetitive machines to complex modular machines in distributed architectures:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>This research was made possible thanks to the hard work of many people not listed on the byline. A huge thanks to the Schneider Electric Team, Mandiant Advanced Practices, FLARE, Consulting, Managed Defense, and everyone else who supported this effort.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>CODECALL communicates with ICS devices using the Modbus protocol, which potentially gives it the ability to interact with devices from different manufacturers. However, the tool contains a specific module to interact with, scan, and attack Schneider Electric's Modicon M251 (TM251MESE) PLC using Codesys, which is used by the company's proprietary EcoStruxure Machine Expert protocol. We have reason to believe the tool also targets Schneider Electric's Modicon M221 Nano PLC and the Modicon M258 PLC, and it potentially affects additional devices leveraging these protocols.</li>

We highlight that the devices targeted by INCONTROLLER are often integrated in automation machinery (e.g., a milling machine or press) and could plausibly be present in a variety of industrial sectors and processes even without the user's explicit knowledge.</li>

The targeted devices are embedded in multiple types of machinery and could plausibly be present in many different industrial sectors. Given the consistencies with prior Russia-nexus threat activity, we suggest that INCONTROLLER poses the greatest threat to Ukraine, NATO member states, and other states actively responding to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

                                        <li>In early 2022, Mandiant, in partnership with Schneider Electric, analyzed a set of novel industrial control system (ICS)-oriented attack toolswhich we call INCONTROLLER (aka PIPEDREAM)built to target machine automation devices. The tools can interact with specific industrial equipment embedded in different types of machinery leveraged across multiple industries. While the targeting of any operational environments using this toolset is unclear, the malware poses a critical risk to organizations leveraging the targeted equipment. INCONTROLLER is very likely state sponsored and contains capabilities related to disruption, sabotage, and potentially physical destruction.</li>

                                        <li>INCONTROLLER includes three tools that enable the attacker to send instructions to ICS devices using industrial network protocols, such as OPC UA; Modbus; Codesys, which is used by EcoStruxure Machine Expert and SoMachine; and Omron FINS. While the tool's capabilities could enable the actor to communicate with a variety of products from different original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the actor developed modules for specific controllers from Schneider Electric and Omron. The targeted equipment consists of machine automation solutions whose use cases span from supporting simple, repetitive machines to complex modular machines in distributed architectures:</li>

However, the tool contains a specific module to interact with, scan, and attack Schneider Electric's Modicon M251 (TM251MESE) PLC using Codesys, which is used by the company's proprietary EcoStruxure Machine Expert protocol.

                                        <li>We developed three cyber physical attack scenarios that highlight a range of possible outcomes from an attack using INCONTROLLER. In each of the three cases, TAGRUN could have been used at earlier stages to enumerate the victim environment, identify its targets, and learn about the physical process.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Search for and investigate irregular connections to OPC UA endpoints and enable robust audit logging for OPC UA applications. Aggregate OPC UA logs and audit records to a central location where applicable.<br/>Review OPC UA audit records for evidence of credential bruteforcing, nefarious certificate usage, irregular connection attempts, configuration changes, and changes to OPC tags.<br/>Search for and investigate TAGRUN ping command execution.<br/>Review OT network traffic for evidence of pingsweep activity.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>TAGRUN's capabilities, such as the ability to scan for and enumerate OPC UA servers, suggests a reconnaissance role. OPC acts as a central communications protocol to collect and store data from ICS assets in industrial environments. Access to this data can provide attackers with a detailed overview of production systems and control processes. The tool was likely developed for reconnaissance, but it can also write and change tag values, which could be used to modify data to either support an attack or mask process changes. TAGRUN also verifies whether the target environment is running a Windows operating system and provides different ping commands depending on this check's return value. This suggests that the actor may use non-Windows devices to execute TAGRUN.</li>

                                        <li>TAGRUN's capabilities, such as the ability to scan for and enumerate OPC UA servers, suggests a reconnaissance role. OPC acts as a central communications protocol to collect and store data from ICS assets in industrial environments. Access to this data can provide attackers with a detailed overview of production systems and control processes. The tool was likely developed for reconnaissance, but it can also write and change tag values, which could be used to modify data to either support an attack or mask process changes. TAGRUN also verifies whether the target environment is running a Windows operating system and provides different ping commands depending on this check's return value. This suggests that the actor may use non-Windows devices to execute TAGRUN.</li>

The framework is modular, which means the attacker can develop and deploy additional capabilities into the tool.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>INCONTROLLER includes three tools that enable the attacker to send instructions to ICS devices using industrial network protocols, such as OPC UA; Modbus; Codesys, which is used by EcoStruxure Machine Expert and SoMachine; and Omron FINS. While the tool's capabilities could enable the actor to communicate with a variety of products from different original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the actor developed modules for specific controllers from Schneider Electric and Omron. The targeted equipment consists of machine automation solutions whose use cases span from supporting simple, repetitive machines to complex modular machines in distributed architectures:</li>

INCONTROLLER similarly allows the malware operator to manipulate physical processes, while also containing denial-of-service (DoS) capabilities to disrupt the availability of PLCs.</li>

The tool was likely developed for reconnaissance, but it can also write and change tag values, which could be used to modify data to either support an attack or mask process changes. TAGRUN also verifies whether the target environment is running a Windows operating system and provides different ping commands depending on this check's return value.

                                        <li>While the nature of any potential intended victims remains uncertain, INCONTROLLER poses a critical risk to organizations with compatible devices. The targeted devices are embedded in multiple types of machinery and could plausibly be present in many different industrial sectors. Given the consistencies with prior Russia-nexus threat activity, we suggest that INCONTROLLER poses the greatest threat to Ukraine, NATO member states, and other states actively responding to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Organizations should take immediate action to determine if the targeted ICS devices are present in their environments and begin applying vendor-specific countermeasures.</li>

The targeted devices are embedded in multiple types of machinery and could plausibly be present in many different industrial sectors. Given the consistencies with prior Russia-nexus threat activity, we suggest that INCONTROLLER poses the greatest threat to Ukraine, NATO member states, and other states actively responding to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Organizations should take immediate action to determine if the targeted ICS devices are present in their environments and begin applying vendor-specific countermeasures.</li>
