They have been observed attacking political, military, and corporate organizations throughout Asia, with Pakistan, China, Nepal, and Afghanistan being the most common targets. RAZOR TIGER, Rattlesnake, APT-C-17, and T-APT-04 are the aliases for Sidewinder APT. This APT has been targeting Pakistani government officials with a decoy file related to FOCUSED TALK ON RUSSIAN UKRAINE CONFLICT IMPACT ON PAKISTAN in its most recent effort. They employ custom implementations to attack existing vulnerabilities and then deploy a Powershell payload in the final stages to distribute the malware. Sidewinder was also detected employing credential phishing sites that were copied from their victims webmail login pages."
