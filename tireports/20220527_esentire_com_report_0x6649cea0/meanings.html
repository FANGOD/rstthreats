                                        <li>Regardless of the size of your organization or the industry, its likely that your organization will become both a victim and an attack vector for attacks. Although cybercriminals can indirectly target your organization by directly targeting a supply chain vendor, they can also use your organization as a vector to affect businesses downstream to you (i.e., your end consumers). In fact, the SolarWinds attack is a great example of how the hackers were able to remain stealthy by installing malicious code in the Orion software.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>By working with a 24/7 MDR provider who leverages log sources for data correlation and deep investigation, you can engineer new detections for new &amp; emerging threats so your team can catch malicious activity early on.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>We have seen this repeatedly over the past twelve months with attacks against supply chain vendors such as the SolarWinds Orion platform, the Kaseya VSA platform, and the Apache Log4j logging library. The common thread in all these attacks is how threat actors used these MSPs to obfuscate malicious activity and bypass authentication requirements.</li>
