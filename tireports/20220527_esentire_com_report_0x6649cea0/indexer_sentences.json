Consider enriching your log incident data to identify net new IOCs. The threat hunting program your team engages should have demonstrated expertise in investigating the latest threat actor Tactics, Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) through original research, leverage enriched threat intelligence, proactively identify threats, and streamline investigations using the best-of-breed platforms."}
