TA410 is a cyberespionage umbrella group loosely linked to APT10, known mostly for targeting US-based organizations in the utilities sector, and diplomatic organizations in the Middle East and Africa. TA410 has been active since at least 2018 and was first publicly revealed in August 2019 by Proofpoint in its LookBack blogpost. A year later, the then-new and very complex malware family called FlowCloud was also attributed to TA410."}

ESET telemetry shows victims all around the world, mainly in the governmental and education sectors. TA410 had access to the most recent known Microsoft Exchange remote code execution vulnerabilities, e.g., ProxyLogon in March 2021 and ProxyShell in August 2021. ESET researchers found a new version of FlowCloud, a complex and modular C++ RAT. It has several interesting capabilities, including: Controlling connected microphones and triggering recording when sound levels above a specified threshold volume are detected. Monitoring clipboard events to steal clipboard content. Monitoring file system events to collect new and modified files. Controlling attached camera devices to take pictures of the compromised computers surroundings. Controlling connected microphones and triggering recording when sound levels above a specified threshold volume are detected. Monitoring clipboard events to steal clipboard content. Monitoring file system events to collect new and modified files. Controlling attached camera devices to take pictures of the compromised computers surroundings. FlowCloud deploys a rootkit to hide its activity on the compromised machine. The LookBack backdoor utilized by TA410 uses a custom network protocol, which can function over HTTP or raw TCP, for C&C server communications. TA410 is one of the users of the Royal Road malicious document builder."}

Much like a voice assistant, FlowCloud can use a computers microphone to listen to its surroundings, but instead of recording being triggered by a command word, it seems to be triggered by any sound over a threshold defined by the decibel_limit field of the audio_policy. The default value is 65 decibels, which is in the upper range of normal conversation volume (commonly defined to be anywhere between 50 and 70 dB by various sources)."}
