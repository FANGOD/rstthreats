Both Docker images target lists overlap with domains reportedly shared by the Ukraine government-backed Ukraine IT Army (UIA).

The most significant difference between the two versions of this image is that the target list was expanded. The target list contains Russian websites from the following sectors: government, military, media, finance, energy, retail, mining, manufacturing, chemicals, production, technology, advertisements, agriculture, transportation and political parties. Also on March 1, 2022, Belarusian websites from the media, retail, government and military sectors were added to the target list. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses the activity deploying this Docker image as very likely automated based on closely overlapping timelines in the interaction with the Docker API. This assessment is made with moderate confidence, based on three separate incidents showing analogous timelines.</li>

Both Docker images target lists overlap with domains reportedly shared by the Ukraine government-backed Ukraine IT Army (UIA). The UIA previously called its members to perform distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against Russian targets.

                                        <li>Between February 27 and March 1, 2022, Docker Engine honeypots were observed to have been compromised in order to execute two different Docker images targeting Russian and Belarusian websites in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Both Docker images target lists overlap with domains reportedly shared by the Ukraine government-backed Ukraine IT Army (UIA). The UIA previously called its members to perform distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against Russian targets. There may be risk of retaliatory activity by threat actors supporting the Russian Federation, against organizations being leveraged to unwittingly conduct disruptive attacks against government, military and civilian websites.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>that uses HTTP-based requests to stress-test a website. In this case, this tool was abused as a DoS tool that starts automatically when a new container based on the Docker image is created. Upon starting, the target-selection routine picks a random entry from a hard-coded target list. Later versions of this Docker image alternatively pick one of the first 24 entries of the target list, based on the current hour.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The CrowdStrike Falcon platform protects its customers with its runtime protection and cloud machine learning models from any post-exploitation activities. As can be seen in Figure 3, the malicious DoS process from the erikmnkl/stoppropaganda image gets terminated by Falcons cloud-based machine learning model, when running the Docker container on a host with the Falcon Sensor for Linux installed.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Container and cloud-based resources are being abused to deploy disruptive tools. The use of compromised infrastructure has far-reaching consequences for organizations who may unwittingly be participating in hostile activity against Russian government, military and civilian targets.<br/>Docker Engine honeypots were compromised to execute two different Docker images targeting Russian, Belarusian and Lithuanian websites in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.<br/>Both Docker images target lists overlap with domains reportedly shared by the Ukraine government-backed Ukraine IT Army (UIA).<br/>The two images have been downloaded over 150,000 times, but CrowdStrike Intelligence cannot assess how many of these downloads originate from compromised infrastructure.<br/>CrowdStrike customers are protected from this threat with the CrowdStrike Falcon Cloud Workload Protection module.</li>

Again, the portion of these downloads that originated from compromised machines is unknown.
