                        "Whilst seemingly uncommon amongst threat actors, UNC2891 frequently used the uuencoding scheme to encode and decode files, such as malware binaries or files containing output from extensive host enumeration scripts. The actor often leveraged simple Perl wrapper scripts that performed uuencoding and uudecoding functions.",
                        "In the case of the systemd variant, UNC2891 also leveraged systemd service unit files for persistence of the TINYSHELL backdoor.",
                        "To keep their network of TINYSHELL connections hidden, UNC2891 had installed and configured a rootkit to filter out these connections from network connection related APIs (keep reading for details on the CAKETAP rootkit). UNC2891 configured remotely accessible systems with TINYSHELL backdoors that used dynamic DNS domains for their external command and control channel. These domains were created per-host and were not used more than once, the subdomains sometimes resembled the hostname of the compromised machine. Mandiant was unable to collect passive DNS data for these dynamic DNS domains, suggesting that UNC2891 had likely enabled IP resolution for short periods of time when access to the network was required. At one victim, these TINYSHELL backdoors were configured to perform communications using TCP over port 53 and 443, likely as a mechanism to bypass outbound network protections, blend in with existing traffic, and evade detection.",
                        "CAKETAP is a kernel module rootkit that UNC2891 deployed on key server infrastructure running Oracle Solaris. CAKETAP can hide network connections, processes, and files. During initialization, it removes itself from the loaded modules list and updates the last_module_id with the previously loaded module to hide its presence.",
                        "Mandiant discovered UNC2891 leveraging a similar in-memory dropper that also used environment variables to decrypt its embedded payload but instead relied on RC4 encryption, we have named this STEELHOUND. In addition to functioning as dropper for an embedded payload, STEELHOUND is also able to encrypt new payloads by encrypting a target binary and writing it to disk along with a copy of itself and an end-of-file configuration.",
                        "Like past UNC1945 intrusions, Mandiant observed UNC2891 make extensive use of the Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) based backdoor we track as SLAPSTICK to aid with credential harvesting, and to provide backdoor access to compromised machines in victim networks. As detailed in our previous blog post, SLAPSTICK provides persistent backdoor access to infected systems with a hard-coded magical password, it also logs authentication attempts and corresponding passwords in an encrypted log file. Although this is expected to have tremendously assisted UNC2891 with credential harvesting and lateral movement activities, it also provided valuable information to Mandiant Incident Responders. Although SLAPSTICK log files were often timestomped, Mandiant was able to decode them and trace some of the actors lateral movement activities through the usage of the backdoor provided magical password.",
                        "Figure 2: Example of TINYSHELL command and control used by UNC2891",
                        "While some of the overlaps between UNC2891 and UNC1945 are notable, it is not conclusive enough to attribute the intrusions to a single threat group. For example, it is possible that significant portions of UNC2891 and UNC1945 activity are carried out by an entity that is a common resource to multiple threat actors, which could explain the perceived difference in intrusion objectivesa common malware developer or an intrusion partner, for example. Regardless, Mandiant is releasing this information on the actor to raise awareness of the fraudulent activity and aid defenders in uncovering further UNC2891 operations.",
                        "Alongside SLAPSTICK, UNC2891 often installed a custom variant of the publicly available TINYSHELL backdoor. UNC2891 TINYSHELL backdoors leveraged an external encrypted configuration file and some variants included additional functionality, such as the ability to communicate via a HTTP proxy with basic authentication. In line with the groups familiarity with Unix and Linux based systems, UNC2891 often named and configured their TINYSHELL backdoors with values that masqueraded as legitimate services that might be overlooked by investigators, such as systemd (SYSTEMD), name service cache daemon (NCSD), and the Linux at daemon (ATD).",
                        "Since that time, Mandiant has investigated and attributed several intrusions to a threat cluster we believe has a nexus to this actor, currently being tracked as UNC2891. Through these investigations, Mandiant has discovered additional techniques, malware, and utilities being used by UNC2891 alongside those previously observed in use by UNC1945. Despite having identified significant overlaps between these threat clusters, Mandiant has not determined they are attributable to the same actor.",
                        "Based on Mandiants investigation findings, we believe that CAKETAP was leveraged by UNC2891 as part of a larger operation to successfully use fraudulent bank cards to perform unauthorized cash withdrawals from ATM terminals at several banks.",
                        "UNC2891 maintains a high level of OPSEC and employs several techniques to evade detection. The actor uses their skill and experience to take full advantage of the decreased visibility and security measures that are often present in Unix and Linux environments. Mandiant expects that UNC2891 will continue to capitalize on this and perform similar operations for financial gain that target mission critical systems running these operating systems.",
                        "UNC2891 often made use of the STEELCORGI in-memory dropper which decrypts its embedded payloads by deriving a ChaCha20 key from the value of an environment variable obtained at runtime. In many cases, Mandiant was unable to recover the requisite environment variables to decrypt the embedded payloads. However, in the limited samples we were able to decrypt, UNC2891 had deployed different versions of an extensive toolkit which appears to be developed under the name SUN4ME. SUN4ME contains tools for network reconnaissance, host enumeration, exploitation of known vulnerabilities, log wiping, file operations, as well as common shell utilities. Yoroi has previously published information about this toolkit following our previous blog post on UNC1945s usage of STEELCORGI.",
                        "Based on analyzed configurations, UNC2891 had configured TINYSHELL backdoors in a multi-hop structure that leveraged several compromised internal servers for command and control. In one case, Mandiant found evidence that suggests the actor had chained different TINYSHELL variants together to obtain remote access to a server inside a network segment with network restrictions.",
                        "The mkdirat hook enabled UNC2891 to control and configure CAKETAP through existing backdoor access to compromised servers by issuing shell commands that leverage these system calls (e.g. mkdir for mkdirat). A single character appended to the signal string indicated which command was to be executed. The following commands were observed:",
                        "Mandiant previously observed UNC1945 use a large amount of different public and private tools during their intrusions, and this was also true for UNC2891. Mandiant discovered additional utilities that were leveraged by UNC2891:",
                        "UNC2891 intrusions appear to be financially motivated and in some cases spanned several years through which the actor had remained largely undetected.<crlf>UNC2891 demonstrated fluency and expertise in Unix and Linux environments, mostly through the targeting of Oracle Solaris based systems with TINYSHELL and SLAPSTICK backdoors.<crlf>Mandiant observed UNC2891 operate with a high degree of OPSEC and leverage both public and private malware, utilities, and scripts to remove evidence and hinder response efforts.<crlf>Mandiant discovered a previously unknown rootkit for Oracle Solaris systems that UNC2891 used to remain hidden in victim networks, we have named this CAKETAP.<crlf>One Variant of CAKETAP manipulated messages transiting a victims Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) switching network.

                        "Mandiant observed UNC2891 load CAKETAP with the module name ipstat from attacker created directories that often resided somewhere inside the /var directory tree."

As detailed in our previous blog post, SLAPSTICK provides persistent backdoor access to infected systems with a hard-coded magical password, it also logs authentication attempts and corresponding passwords in an encrypted log file. Although this is expected to have tremendously assisted UNC2891 with credential harvesting and lateral movement activities, it also provided valuable information to Mandiant Incident Responders.

UNC2891 configured remotely accessible systems with TINYSHELL backdoors that used dynamic DNS domains for their external command and control channel. These domains were created per-host and were not used more than once, the subdomains sometimes resembled the hostname of the compromised machine. Mandiant was unable to collect passive DNS data for these dynamic DNS domains, suggesting that UNC2891 had likely enabled IP resolution for short periods of time when access to the network was required. At one victim, these TINYSHELL backdoors were configured to perform communications using TCP over port 53 and 443, likely as a mechanism to bypass outbound network protections, blend in with existing traffic, and evade detection.",

In line with the groups familiarity with Unix and Linux based systems, UNC2891 often named and configured their TINYSHELL backdoors with values that masqueraded as legitimate services that might be overlooked by investigators, such as systemd (SYSTEMD), name service cache daemon (NCSD), and the Linux at daemon (ATD).",

This resulted in the HSM not performing the proper card verification and instead generating a valid response. Fraudulent bank cards generated verification messages using a custom algorithm using the Primary Account Number (PAN) and other parameters which served as a marker for CAKETAP. CAKETAP examined outgoing messages and if it matched the algorithm, CAKETAP identified the card as fraudulent and stored the PAN in memory to use in the following step.<crlf>Replay of PIN verification messages: CAKETAP examined outgoing PIN verification messages that matched certain conditions and identified those with a Primary Account Number (PAN) that reflected a fraudulent card. If the message was not for a fraudulent card, it would save the message internally and send it unmodified, as to not interrupt legitimate ATM PIN verifications. However, if it was for a fraudulent card, CAKETAP would instead replace the message content with data from a previously saved message.

UNC2891 configured remotely accessible systems with TINYSHELL backdoors that used dynamic DNS domains for their external command and control channel. These domains were created per-host and were not used more than once, the subdomains sometimes resembled the hostname of the compromised machine. Mandiant was unable to collect passive DNS data for these dynamic DNS domains, suggesting that UNC2891 had likely enabled IP resolution for short periods of time when access to the network was required. At one victim, these TINYSHELL backdoors were configured to perform communications using TCP over port 53 and 443, likely as a mechanism to bypass outbound network protections, blend in with existing traffic, and evade detection."

Fraudulent bank cards generated verification messages using a custom algorithm using the Primary Account Number (PAN) and other parameters which served as a marker for CAKETAP.

                        "Manipulation of card verification messages: CAKETAP altered the mode of certain outgoing messages to disable card verification. This resulted in the HSM not performing the proper card verification and instead generating a valid response. Fraudulent bank cards generated verification messages using a custom algorithm using the Primary Account Number (PAN) and other parameters which served as a marker for CAKETAP. CAKETAP examined outgoing messages and if it matched the algorithm, CAKETAP identified the card as fraudulent and stored the PAN in memory to use in the following step.<crlf>Replay of PIN verification messages: CAKETAP examined outgoing PIN verification messages that matched certain conditions and identified those with a Primary Account Number (PAN) that reflected a fraudulent card. If the message was not for a fraudulent card, it would save the message internally and send it unmodified, as to not interrupt legitimate ATM PIN verifications. However, if it was for a fraudulent card, CAKETAP would instead replace the message content with data from a previously saved message. This was effectively a replay attack that resulted in a bypass of PIN verification for fraudulent cards.",

In many cases, Mandiant was unable to recover the requisite environment variables to decrypt the embedded payloads. However, in the limited samples we were able to decrypt, UNC2891 had deployed different versions of an extensive toolkit which appears to be developed under the name SUN4ME. SUN4ME contains tools for network reconnaissance, host enumeration, exploitation of known vulnerabilities, log wiping, file operations, as well as common shell utilities.

Fraudulent bank cards generated verification messages using a custom algorithm using the Primary Account Number (PAN) and other parameters which served as a marker for CAKETAP. CAKETAP examined outgoing messages and if it matched the algorithm, CAKETAP identified the card as fraudulent and stored the PAN in memory to use in the following step.<crlf>Replay of PIN verification messages: CAKETAP examined outgoing PIN verification messages that matched certain conditions and identified those with a Primary Account Number (PAN) that reflected a fraudulent card.

Fraudulent bank cards generated verification messages using a custom algorithm using the Primary Account Number (PAN) and other parameters which served as a marker for CAKETAP. CAKETAP examined outgoing messages and if it matched the algorithm, CAKETAP identified the card as fraudulent and stored the PAN in memory to use in the following step.<crlf>Replay of PIN verification messages: CAKETAP examined outgoing PIN verification messages that matched certain conditions and identified those with a Primary Account Number (PAN) that reflected a fraudulent card. If the message was not for a fraudulent card, it would save the message internally and send it unmodified, as to not interrupt legitimate ATM PIN verifications. However, if it was for a fraudulent card, CAKETAP would instead replace the message content with data from a previously saved message.
