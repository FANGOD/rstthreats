The global infection looks fairly big as just in China there are more than 10,000 daily active bots (IPs) and alsomore than 100 DDoS victims beingtargeted on a daily basis. We named the botnet Fodcha because of its initial use of the C2 domain name folded.in and its use of the chacha algorithm to encrypt network traffic."

In the past 3 months, the Fodcha samples we captured can be divided into two versions, v1 and v2. Their main functions are almost the same. By cross-referencing the different versions, we can tell that the Fodcha operators are really trying to hide their C2s and load-balance among the C2s.\nThe latest sample of V2 X86 CPU architecture is selected as the main object of analysis in this paper, and its basic information is as follows.\nFodcha's function is simple. When it executes on the compromised device, it first checks the runtime parameters. When there are no parameters, it exits out. Fodcha does this as a simple countermeasure to deter sandbox. When parameters are present, it first decrypts the key configurations data, the data include some sensitive information such as C2s will It then prints here we are on the Console, and uses a random string to disguise the process name. Finally communication with the C2 will be established. The following section will focus on Fodcha's decryption method and network communication.",

We use arm as the packet string, which generates the network traffic shown in the following figure.\nLet us elaborate on how this traffic is generated:\nThe hard-coded ee 00 00 is calculated by the tcp/ip checksum method to get the 2-byte checksum value 0xff11, which is filled to the last 2 bytes.\nNote that the key and nonce are generated by the C2 side, not fixed.\nHard-coded 55 00 00 by checksum, calculate the checksum value 0xffaa, fill in the last 2 bytes, become 55 00 00 aa ff, then use chacha20 algorithm to encrypt, the number of rounds is 1, get 99 9e 95 f6 32.\nAt this point, if the format of the 5 bytes received is 0x55 at the beginning and the last 2 bytes are the checksum value, it means the previous interaction is right, enter Step 5 and ask BOT to start sending packet information.\nFirst time Hard-coded fe 00 00, the third byte is really the grouping length, becomes fe 00 03, calculate the checksum value 0xfefe, fill in the tail to get fe 00 03 fe fe\nSecond time grouping string arm, use chacha20 encryption, round number 1, get ad ec f8\nAt this point the BOT is successfully registered and waits to execute the instruction issued by C2. The instruction code and its meaning are shown below:\n- 0x69, Heartbeat\n- 0xEB, DDoS Attack\n- 0xFB, Exit"

The new C2 is mapped to more than a dozen IPs and is distributed across multiple countries including the US, Korea, Japan, and India, it involves more cloud providers such as Amazon, DediPath, DigitalOcean, Linode, and many others."
