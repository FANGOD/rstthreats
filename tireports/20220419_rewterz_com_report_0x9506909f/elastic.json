Initially, they concentrated on South Korea. It has recently shifted its focus to worldwide targets and began initiating assaults for monetary gain. This actor has been linked to attacks in South Korea, the United States, Japan, and a number of other nations. Lazarus APT is suspected of being behind a number of diverse efforts, including cyberespionage, attacks on financial institutions, government agencies, and the military.\nThis group is said to be behind the wiper attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November 2014 as part of Novettas Operation Blockbuster campaign. Lazarus Groups malware is linked to other known campaigns such as Operation Flame, Operation Troy, DarkSeoul, Operation 1Mission, and Ten Days of Rain\nRecently Lazarus has been linked by the U.S Government to the $625 Million Ronin Network Heist.\nThere has been a security breach on the Ronin Network. Earlier today, we discovered that on March 23rd, Sky Maviss Ronin validator nodes and Axie DAO validator nodes were compromised resulting in 173,600 Ethereum and 25.5M USDC drained from the Ronin bridge in two transactions (1 and 2). reads a statement published by the company. The attacker used hacked private keys in order to forge fake withdrawals. We discovered the attack this morning after a report from a user being unable to withdraw 5k ETH from the bridge."
