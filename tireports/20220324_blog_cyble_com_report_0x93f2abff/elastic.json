Hence, we can infer that the application is packed.\ncom.theseeye5.KSNckdWjjyIXg is the applications subclass initiated on launching the application. The application loads its components from the library file upon analyzing the subclass, as shown below.\nFigure 4 Applications Subclass loading library file\nThe project file browser can also be used for viewing the library files presence. libyvr.so is visible in the screenshot below.\nFigure 5 Library file in Project file representation\nUpon analyzing the .so file, the application acts as a dropper, which is the initial phase of the Coper malware that drops and installs the malwares primary harmful module hiding inside the victims Android device.\nAs seen in Figure 4, the file drops an encrypted.dex file. This file can be decrypted to reveal the Coper malwares malicious code, as shown below.\nFigure 6 Decrypted Dex file\nUpon analyzing the decrypted.dex file, we were able to find the presence of missed Receivers, Services, and Mainactivity of the application. Below, we have listed the malicious activities the application can perform:\nThe application uses the Device Administration API along with the DeviceAdminReceiver subclass to enable/disable device admin to the apps that users install on their devices.\nFigure 7 Enabling/Disabling Device Admin\nThe application can read all the incoming SMS messages from the infected device.\nFigure 8 Reading Incoming SMS\nThe applications entry point/launcher activity reads installed packages from the users device.\nFigure 9 Launcher activity of the malicious application\nThe malware reads the incoming notifications by verifying the packages and steals the messages from the notification using Notification Listener Service.\nFigure 10 Reads and cancels the notification using Notification Listener service\nLike other Banking Trojans, Coper malware requests users to enable the Accessibility Service to perform various Accessibility Event types to conduct malicious activities, as shown in the below figure.\nFigure 11 Accessibility Event Types\nThe malware maintains a connection with the C&C server and queries it every minute. If the malware gets the relevant instructions from the C&C server, the time interval can be altered to ensure the malware gets sufficient time to perform other malicious functionalities.\nCoper malware may also alter additional configuration parameters, as shown in Figure 12.\nFigure 12 Timer Delay and Configuration Changes Performed by malware\nThe list of webinjects or applications for which malicious apps attempt to steal data were also identified. Coper malware usually has a targeted list of applications in their remote server that prohibits them from running in the infected device. Coper malware actively targets banking applications across Europe, Australia, and even parts of South America.\nThe malware also receives commands from the TA through the C&C URL hard coded within the app in encrypted text. Figure 13 depicts the list of commands stored within the app in encrypted text.\nFigure 13 Commands received from C&C server\nThe list of commands used in Coper malware are given below:\nUpon further analysis, we were able to find the hardcoded additional Command and Control (C&C) domains, webinjects, and configuration data by the Malware author. The hard-coded C&C domains and configuration data are shown below.\nFigure 14 Additional C&C domains and configuration data hardcoded by malware author",

This aim may be achieved by implementing a real-time threat-driven mobile security strategy."
