                        "The STOP/DJVU ransomware initially made headlines in 2018 and has since been attacking individuals all around the world. Its widespread on torrent sites and other platforms in software crack packages and adware bundles. The STOP/DJVU ransomware is a Trojan that encrypts files. It infiltrates your computer invisibly and encrypts all of your data, making them unavailable to you. It leaves a ransom letter warning that demands money in exchange for decrypting your data and making them available to you again. Malware is delivered via cracked applications, fake set-up apps keygens, activators, and Windows updates. It does not utilize local information like keyboard layouts or timezone settings to prevent infecting victims in certain countries; instead, it uses the information returned by a request to https[:]//api.2ip.ua/geo.json. The cards MAC address is utilized to provide unique identification for the system. This identity is provided to STOPs command and control server, which responded with an RSA-2048 public key for encryption. Additional malware, including an information stealer known as Vidar, is then downloaded and installed."

It leaves a ransom letter warning that demands money in exchange for decrypting your data and making them available to you again. Malware is delivered via cracked applications, fake set-up apps keygens, activators, and Windows updates.
