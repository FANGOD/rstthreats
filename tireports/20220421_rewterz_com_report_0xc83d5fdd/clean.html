<h2>Analysis Summary</h2>
<p>In early 2016, LokiBot was originally made available on underground forums for cybercriminals to use against Microsoft Android phones. This malware steals sensitive information including, usernames, cryptocurrency wallets, and other credentials via Trojan software. Malware grabs credentials by monitoring browser and desktop activities from the password storage using a keylogger. LokiBot can also install a backdoor into affected systems, allowing an attacker to install other payloads. Spam emails, communication channels such as SMS, Skype, and malicious websites are all used to spread LokiBot. This malware is utilized to keep track of what users are doing (for instance, recording keystrokes).</p>
