Self-extracting archives, also known as SFX files, are Windows executable files that, upon execution, extract the compressed content. Figure 2 showcases the installation wizard.\nFigure 2: Installation Wizard\nThe installation file drops the files shown in Figure 3 and executes the payload named Payload.exe. The dropped files also contain manuals for using the builder and the binaries.\nFigure 3: Extracted files\nThe payload file (SHA256:b6135c446093a19544dbb36018adb7139aa810a3f3eaa45663dc54448fe30e39) is a .NET based binary. Figure 4 shows the payload details.\nFigure 4: File information\nFigure 5 shows the process flow for the clipper malware. The malware extracts the data from the clipboard and then uses a regular expression to find the crypto addresses. If theres a match, the malware replaces the address with one specified by TA.\nFigure 5: Clipper malware process flow"

In one of the scenarios, the malware creator can target other TAs who use the builder for customizing the crypto stealer and their victims. This clipper can do financial theft at a great level, so it becomes necessary to take preventive measures."
