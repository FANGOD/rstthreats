            "text": "A few days ago, we discovered an interesting sample that we believe is part of the Nobelium campaign, also known as Dark Halo. The document was uploaded to the VirusTotal service from Spain. It contains an attractive visual lure representing a document from the Israeli embassy. We will look at the threat vector and provide some indicators of attack that can help defenders identify or respond.\nFigure 1: A visual lure that mimics a broken font.\nThe visual lure is designed so that the target would interpret that the font is not displayed and activate the embedded content. Multiple scans of the file in the Virustotal service did not detect the ill intent. The original name of this file is Ambassador_Absense.docx.\nFigure 2: Abysmal detection history\nFigure 3: Total evasion\nWhen opening the document and activating content, the HTA script is launched, invoking a piece of JS. The script has the functionality to decrypt the executable library and run it.\nFigure 4: The JavaScript drops a DLL\nThe image above shows how the program decrypts the payload with a normal xor operation with a hardcoded key. The executable library is created in the following directory.\nC:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\..\\IconCacheService.dll\nOnce launched, the malicious code collects data about the system on which it is launched. And sends the details to a remote server.\nFigure 5: Enumeration functions\nAfter sending all the data, the server waits for a response and for receiving further payload to execute. The program uses trello.com to exchange data. This is so done in order to complicate the attribution and belonging of the work to any threat actor.",
