                        "When the user opens the document with macros enabled, an HTA file will be dropped on the system and launched using cmd.exe. The HTA file is used to download the Trickbot DLL from a remote server.",
                        "NB: Patterns related to TA551 evolved with time, since mid-August 2021, the pattern changed to \"/bmdff/\". The DLL is registered as a jpg file to hide the real extension, and it tries to be run via regsvr32.exe. Then, Trickbot will be injected into \"wermgr.exe\" using Process Hollowing techniques.",
                        "Orange Cyberdefense's CyberSOCs have been tracking the specific malware named Trickbot for quite some time. It is commonly attributed to a specific Threat Actor generally known under the name of Wizard Spider (Crowdstrike), UNC1778 (FireEye) or Gold Blackburn (Secureworks).",
                        "After the successful initial system compromise, Trickbot can collect a lot of information about its target using legitimate Windows executables and identify if the system is member of an Active Directory domain.",
                        "All requests to a Trickbot C2 use the following format:",
                        "Origins of Trickbot",
                        "NB: The Threat Actor used the same modus operandi before/in parallel to Trickbot to deliver other malware. We observed during the same period, from June 2021 to September 2021, the use of Bazarloader on the initial access payload.",
                        "This threat analysis will be focused on the threat actor named TA551, and its use of Trickbot as an example. I will present how we are able to perform detection at the different steps of the kill chain, starting from the initial infection through malspam campaigns, moving on to the detection of tools used by the threat actor during compromise. We will also provide some additional information about how the threat actor is using this malware and the evolution it took.",
                        "Of course, there is no such thing as bullet-proof preventive protection in cyber. It's all the more important to have the capability of detecting Trickbot at an early stage. Though the attack chain can be broken at every stage along the way: the later it is, the higher the risk of full compromise and the resulting damage. Trickbot is used by different threat actors, but the detection approach stays the same on most of its specific stages. Some of the indicators of compromise are explained here. But malware gets updates too.",
                        "Let's see this mechanic in action as we follow an actual CyberSOC analyst investigating the case of the malware dubbed \"Trickbot.\"",
                        "When the system is infected, it can contact several kinds of Trickbot C2. The main C2 is the one with which the victim system will communicate, mainly to get new instructions.",
                        "Trickbot is a popular and modular Trojan initially used in targeting the banking industry, that has meanwhile been used to compromise companies from other industries as well. It delivers several types of payloads. Trickbot evolved progressively to be used as Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) by different attack groups.",
                        "Trickbot is also able to collect sensitive information like banking data or credentials, and exfiltrate it to a dedicated command and control server (C2).",
                        "Additionally, to this collection, Trickbot will scan more information like Windows build, the public IP address, the user that is running Trickbot, and also if the system is behind an NAT firewall.",
                        "All data collected is sent to a separate Exfiltration Trickbot C2 using HTTP POST request methods. The request format keeps the same, but the command \"90\" is specific to data exfiltration, more precisely system data collected off the infected system.",
                        "Since June 2021, the group TA551 started delivering the Trickbot malware using an encrypted zip. The email pretext mimics an important information to reduce the vigilance of the user."

One factor is that certain reused modules commonly found in malware can be used to identify, track, and analyze professional attack software. Ultimately this means that, with enough experience, skilled analysts can detect and stop malware in its tracks, often with minimal or no damage (if the attackers make it through the first defense lines at all).",

Malware is an industry, and professional developers are found to exchange, be it by stealing one's code or deliberate collaboration. Attacks are multi-layer these days, with diverse sophisticated software apps taking over different jobs along the attack-chain from initial compromise to ultimate data exfiltration or encryption. The specific tools for each stage are highly specialized and can often be rented as a service, including customer support and subscription models for professional (ab)use. Obviously, this has largely increased both the availability and the potential effectiveness and impact of malware. Sound scary?",
                        "Of course, there is no such thing as bullet-proof preventive protection in cyber. It's all the more important to have the capability of detecting Trickbot at an early stage. Though the attack chain can be broken at every stage along the way: the later it is, the higher the risk of full compromise and the resulting damage. Trickbot is used by different threat actors, but the detection approach stays the same on most of its specific stages. Some of the indicators of compromise are explained here. But malware gets updates too.",

We will also provide some additional information about how the threat actor is using this malware and the evolution it took.",
