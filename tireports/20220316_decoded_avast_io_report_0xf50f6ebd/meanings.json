                        "Based on the amount of active DirtyMoe instances, it can be argued that worming can threaten hundreds of thousands of computers per day. Furthermore, new vulnerabilities, such as Log4j, provide a tremendous and powerful opportunity to implement a new worming module. With this in mind, our researchers continue to monitor the worming activities and hunt for other worming modules.",
                        "This research analyzes this worming modules kill chain and the procedures used to launch/control the module through the DirtyMoe service. Other areas investigated include evaluating the risk of identified exploits used by the worm and detailed analysis of how its victim selection algorithm works. Finally, we examine this performance and provide a thorough examination of the entire worming workflow.",
                        "This article focuses on the DirtyMoe worming module. We analyze and discuss the worming strategy, which exploits are abused by the malware author, and a module behavior according to geological locations. One of the main topics is the performance of IP address generation, which is crucial for the malwares success. We are also looking for specific implementations of abused exploits, including their origins.",
                        "The DirtyMoe worming module implements three basic phases common to all types of vulnerabilities. First, the module generates a list of IP addresses to target in the initial phase. Then, the second phase attacks specific vulnerabilities against these targets. Finally, the module performs dictionary attacks against live machines represented by the randomly generated IP addresses. The most common modules that we have observed are SMB and SQL.",
                        "The core of the @RCE@ command is the execution of the remote DirtyMoe object (http://) via msiexec in silent mode (/Q). An example of a specific @RCE@ command is:",
                        "In the fourth series on this malware family, we described the deployment of the DirtyMoe service. Figure 2 illustrates the DirtyMoe hierarchy. The DirtyMoe service is run as a svchost process that starts two other processes: DirtyMoe Core and Executioner, which manages DirtyMoe modules. Typically, the executioner loads two modules; one for Monero mining and the other for worming replication.",
                        "Our research has been focused on worming since it seems that worming is one of the main mediums to spread the DirtyMoe malware. The PurpleFox worm described by Guardicore [2] is just the tip of the worming iceberg because DirtyMoe utilizes sophisticated algorithms and methods to spread itself into the wild and even to spread laterally in the local network.",
                        "The worming module is managed by the DirtyMoe service, which controls its configuration, initialization, and worming execution. This section describes the lifecycle of the worming module.",

                        "The DirtyMoe malware is deployed using various kits like PurpleFox or injected installers of Telegram Messenger that require user interaction. Complementary to this deployment, one of the DirtyMoe modules expands the malware using worm-like techniques that require no user interaction.",

                        "The second placeholder is @FIN@ representing the DirtyMoe objects name; this is, in fact, an MSI installer package. The package filename is in the form of a hash [A-F0-9]{8}\\.moe. The hash name is generated using a hardcoded hash table, methods for rotations and substrings, and by the MS_RPC_<n> string, where n is a number determined by the DirtyMoe service.",
                        "When the worming module, represented by the new process, is injected and resumed by the DirtyMoe service, the module initialization is invoked. Firstly, the module unpacks a word dictionary containing passwords for a dictionary attack. The dictionary consists of 100,000 commonly used passwords compressed using LZMA. Secondly, internal structures are established as follows:",
                        "The primary goal of this research was to analyze one of the DirtyMoe module groups, which provides the spreading of the DirtyMoe malware using worming techniques. The second aim of this study was to investigate the effects of worming and investigate which exploits are in use.",
                        "The DirtyMoe service contacts one of the C&C servers and downloads an appropriate worming module into a Shim Database (SDB) file located at %windir%\\apppatch\\TK<volume-id>MS.sdb. The worming module is then decrypted and injected into a new svchost.exe process, as Figure 2 illustrates.",
                        "The prevalence of DirtyMoe is increasing in all corners of the world; this may be due to the DirtyMoe worms strategy of generating targets using a pseudo-random IP generator that considers the worms geological and local location. A consequence of this technique is that the worm is more flexible and effective given its location. In addition, DirtyMoe can be expanded to machines hidden behind NAT as this strategy also provides lateral movement in local networks. A single DirtyMoe instance can generate and attack up to 6,000 IP addresses per second.",

                        "The main goal of the worming module is to achieve RCE under administrator privileges and install a new DirtyMoe instance. The general form of the executed command (@RCE@) is the same for each worming module:",
                        "In most cases, DirtyMoe is deployed using external exploit kits like PurpleFox or injected installers of Telegram Messenger that require user interaction to successful infiltration. Importantly, worming is controlled by C&C and executed by active DirtyMoe instances, so user interaction is not required.",
                        "The encrypted module is a PE executable that contains additional placeholders. The DirtyMoe service passes configuration parameters to the module via these placeholders. This approach is identical to other DirtyMoe modules; however, some of the placeholders are not used in the case of the worming module.",
                        "IP is the number representing the machine IP from which the attack will be carried out. The IP is input for the methods generating IPs; see Section 4. If the IP is not available, the default address 98.126.89.1 is used.<crlf>PNG_ID is the number used to derive the hash-name that mirrors the DirtyMoe object name (MSI installer package) stored at C&C.

                        "In brief, there are four payloads used for the DirtyMoe installation. The SQL worming module defines a placeholder @SQLEXEC@ representing a full URL to the MSI installation package located in the C&C server. If any of the payloads successfully performed a privilege escalation, the DirtyMoe installation is silently launched via MSI installer; see our DirtyMoe Deployment blog post for more details.",
                        "The PurpleFox exploit kit (EK) is the most frequently observed approach to deploy DirtyMoe; the immediate focus of PurpleFox EK is to exploit a victim machine and install DirtyMoe. PurpleFox EK primarily abuses vulnerabilities in the Internet Explorer browser via phishing emails or popunder ads. For example, Guardicore described a worm spread by PurpleFox that abuses SMB services with weak passwords [2], infiltrating poorly secured systems. Recently, Minerva Labs has described the new infection vector installing DirtyMoe via an injected Telegram Installer [1].",
                        "Currently, we are monitoring three approaches used to spread DirtyMoe in the wild; Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between the individual concepts. The primary function of the DirtyMoe malware is crypto-mining; it is deployed to victims machines using different techniques. We have observed PurpleFox EK, PurleFox Worm, and injected Telegram Installers as mediums to spread and install DirtyMoe; we consider it highly likely that other mechanisms are used in the wild.",
                        "DirtyMoe, the successful malware we documented in detail in the previous series, also implements mechanisms to reproduce itself. The most common way of deploying the DirtyMoe malware is via phishing campaigns or malvertising. In this series, we will focus on techniques that help DirtyMoe to spread in the wild.",
                        "We have detected three versions of the DirtyMoe worming module in use. Two versions specifically focus on the SMB service and MS SQL servers. However, the third contains several artifacts implying other attack vectors targeting PHP, Java Deserialization, and Oracle Weblogic Server. We continue to monitor and track these activities."

PurpleFox EK primarily abuses vulnerabilities in the Internet Explorer browser via phishing emails or popunder ads. For example, Guardicore described a worm spread by PurpleFox that abuses SMB services with weak passwords [2], infiltrating poorly secured systems. Recently, Minerva Labs has described the new infection vector installing DirtyMoe via an injected Telegram Installer [1].",

The most common way of deploying the DirtyMoe malware is via phishing campaigns or malvertising. In this series, we will focus on techniques that help DirtyMoe to spread in the wild.",
                        "The PurpleFox exploit kit (EK) is the most frequently observed approach to deploy DirtyMoe; the immediate focus of PurpleFox EK is to exploit a victim machine and install DirtyMoe. PurpleFox EK primarily abuses vulnerabilities in the Internet Explorer browser via phishing emails or popunder ads. For example, Guardicore described a worm spread by PurpleFox that abuses SMB services with weak passwords [2], infiltrating poorly secured systems. Recently, Minerva Labs has described the new infection vector installing DirtyMoe via an injected Telegram Installer [1]."
