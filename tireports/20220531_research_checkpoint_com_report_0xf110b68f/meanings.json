                        "At the same time, XLoader, Formbooks successor which we described last year, has already received 2 updates since our publication. In this article, we describe the most important changes that we found in XLoader version 2.5.",
                        "All XLoader samples have 64 domains and one URI in their configurations. The XLoader configuration has the same structure as the Formbook configuration. In earlier versions Formbook used the URI stored separately in the configuration to access its C&C server. The 64 domains from the malware configuration are actually decoys, intended to distract the researchers attention.",
                        "To stay in business, malware actors have to stay in the forefront of progress and invent new tricks to prolong the lives of their creations as long as possible. In the case of XLoader malware, we see a vivid example of such a process.",
                        "As we can see, XLoader 2.5 introduced an additional code that replaces one more domain in the list with a fixed value. Interestingly, this value doesnt appear anywhere else in the code and is not saved; its position in the list of 16 domains is chosen randomly.",
                        "In July 2021, CPR released a series of three publications covering different aspects of how the Formbook and XLoader malware families function. We described how XLoader emerged in the Darknet community to fill the empty niche after Formbook sales were abruptly stopped by its author. We did a deep technical analysis followed by a description of XLoader for macOS along with common points and differences in how both malware families conceal the heart of the whole operation, the Command-and-Control (C&C) infrastructure. However, the world does not stand still, and this applies to the malware cyber-world as well.",
                        "Figure 3 XLoader doesnt overwrite the C&C domain index.",
                        "However, when emulating samples in a sandbox, we noticed a change. With a long emulation time, the sample accessed more than 16 domains, unlike earlier versions. This behavior forced us to put aside automated analysis tools and arm ourselves with a disassembler. We soon discovered the part of the code responsible for the detected anomaly. As in the previous versions, XLoader first creates a list of 16 domains that are randomly selected from the 64 domains stored in the configuration. After each attempt to access the selected 16 domains, the following code is executed:",
                        "Also, most of them appear only once in various configurations, making them the underdogs in our preliminary bet for the real C&C candidates. From our previous research, we remembered that the number of real C&C servers was relatively small (we found less than 100 C&C servers among 90,000 domains used by the malware), and they were reused in many of the campaigns of different XLoader customers.",
                        "In this article we described all the steps you need to take, and all the details you need to pay attention to in order to identify the real C&C domain among the 65 encountered in every XLoader sample. We analyzed more than 100,000 domains to discover a tiny percentage of actual C&C servers in the multitude of abused domains only 120 of the real servers, which is about 0.12% of the total number.",

                        "In July 2021, we described the method of uncovering real C&C servers among the thousands of legitimate servers abused by XLoader v.2.3. The upgraded XLoader v.2.5 introduced significant changes in this algorithm using the power of the Law of Big Numbers from probability theory. These modifications achieve two goals at once: each node in the botnet maintains a steady knockback rate while fooling automated scripts and preventing the discovery of the real C&C servers. The latter indeed became more difficult, but not impossible.",
                        "Figure 8 XLoader 2.5 replaces three domains in the created list with 2 decoys and the real C&C server domain.",
                        "On May 5, 2022, we spotted a new version of XLoader malware in-the-wild. The main update in XLoader v2.6 concerns the network communication. The random index of the real C&C server is now saved in the malware state structure:",
                        "The Formbook malware has not been updated for quite a long time. The latest version of this stealer is 4.1, and we already observed samples of this version in far 2020. This gives us reason to believe that Formbook has been discontinued.",

                        "A couple of months after our publications were released, we spotted a new XLoader version in-the-wild which was an upgrade of all the ones we described previously. The enhanced version features significant modifications in key parts of the malware logic to truly deserve the differentiation if compared with XLoaders previous implementation.",
                        "In this article, we describe the changes malware authors applied to XLoader to obscure the C&C infrastructure more than anything we saw before. Now it is significantly harder to separate the wheat from the chaff and discover the real C&C servers among thousands of legitimate domains used by Xloader as a smokescreen. We explain how we got to the essence and identified the real C&C nodes in the evolving botnet.",
                        "Figure 11 XLoader 2.6 doesnt overwrite the fake and the C&C domain indices.",
                        "The first samples of the new version of XLoader appeared in-the-wild a month after our publications in August 2021, Revealing the XLoaders C&C infrastructure. At first glance, we didnt see any difference because the configuration structure remained exactly the same.",
                        "In Formbook version 4.1, the malware developers added another level of stealth which also migrated to early versions of XLoader (up to 2.5). A domain name for the real C&C server was hidden among the 64 decoys, while the URI that was always thought to be an address of the C&C server became another decoy and could point to a legitimate website. The malware of versions mentioned above randomly choose 16 decoy domains, two of which are replaced with the fake C&C server address and a real C&C server address. The real C&C server is accessed after a long delay.",
                        "The purpose of this piece of code is to partially overwrite the list of accessed domains with new random values. Therefore, if XLoader runs long enough, it will access new randomly selected domains. Its important to pay attention to the fact that only the first 8 values are overwritten, and the remaining 8 remain the same as those that were selected immediately after launch.",
                        "We continue to stay vigilant for any upcoming changes that might be implemented by future versions, not only in XLoader but in other malware families as well.",

A domain name for the real C&C server was hidden among the 64 decoys, while the URI that was always thought to be an address of the C&C server became another decoy and could point to a legitimate website. The malware of versions mentioned above randomly choose 16 decoy domains, two of which are replaced with the fake C&C server address and a real C&C server address.

We described how XLoader emerged in the Darknet community to fill the empty niche after Formbook sales were abruptly stopped by its author. We did a deep technical analysis followed by a description of XLoader for macOS along with common points and differences in how both malware families conceal the heart of the whole operation, the Command-and-Control (C&C) infrastructure. However, the world does not stand still, and this applies to the malware cyber-world as well.",

In reality, the probability of such an event is even lower as a cycle time period can vary between 80 and 90 seconds, and the probability of the real C&C server to show up in a cycle may be higher and equal to 1/8.",

In this case, the probability that a real C&C server will be accessed in the next cycle is 7/64 or 1/8 depending on the position of the fake c2 (2) domain (see Figure 9 above).",
