                        "Once it had expanded its reach to networking devices, Trickbot began infecting MikroTik routers and modules and using them as proxy servers for its C2 servers and redirecting router traffic through alternative non-standard ports.",
                        "Microsoft did the tech community a huge favor by giving away their security tool for free, but this may not be the end for Trickbot. Unfortunately, as long as MikroTik devices continue to operate without having their firmware updated and their devices monitored, Trickbot will probably stay around.",
                        "In mid-March, Microsoft released a free, open-source tool that can be used to secure MikroTik routers. The tool, RouterOS Scanner, has its source code available on GitHub. It is designed to analyze routers for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) associated with Trickbot. This article will introduce some background on the MikroTik vulnerability, the Trickbot malware, and some ways you can protect yourself.",
                        "In the end, catching on to how Trickbot worked involved sniffing out commands that were specific to the unique operating system, RouterOS and RouterBOARD, used by MikroTik IoT devices.",
                        "The reason hackers use Trickbot is that it allows compromised IoT devices to communicate between the C2 server and other compromised devices. Hackers then breach target routers, typically using a combination of brute force and exploits.",
                        "Another thing all Internet users should do is change their default passwords to more secure unique passwords. Much of the damage done by Trickbot and the MikroTik exploits was because of default passwords shipped with the devices. Changing your default passwords will ensure that brute-forcing your network will be much harder.",
                        "Malware is particularly dangerous because it can be ransomware, a special type of malware that takes control over your computer or devices. Trickbot, as it has grown and evolved, now includes a plug-in for backdoor access for Ryuk, a piece of ransomware with crypto-mining capabilities.",
                        "Researchers at Microsoft on the Microsoft Defender for IoT team discovered the exact mechanism that Trickbots C2 system used to exploit MikroTik devices. Hopefully, by discovering its inner workings, Trickbot will be stamped out for good.",
                        "What makes the infection of MikroTik routers so significant is that they are used by millions of homes and organizations worldwide. The broad distribution of MikroTik routers gave Trickbot extensive infrastructure. Security flaws, like the MikroTik one, can be particularly important for web design because coders that work on the back end have to ensure that web pages are secure.",
                        "As Trickbot has evolved, it began to reach Internet of Things (IoT) devices like routers. Since Trickbot continuously improves its persistence capabilities by dodging researchers and their reverse engineering attempts, it has been able to maintain the stability of its command-and-control (C2) framework.",
                        "Trickbot was first discovered in 2016 and, despite efforts by Microsoft to stamp it out, has continued to remain a threat online. One of the main reasons for Trickbots persistence is that it has continued to change and evolve over the years. As a result, Trickbot has proven to be an adaptable, sophisticated trojan of modular nature, molding itself for different networks, environments, and devices."

It is designed to analyze routers for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) associated with Trickbot. This article will introduce some background on the MikroTik vulnerability, the Trickbot malware, and some ways you can protect yourself."
