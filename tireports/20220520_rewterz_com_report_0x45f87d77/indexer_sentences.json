Passwords Ensure that general security policies are employed including: implementing strong passwords, correct configurations, and proper administration security policies. Admin Access limit access to administrative accounts and portals to only relevant personnel and make sure they are not publicly accessible. WAF Web defacement must be stopped at the web application level. Therefore, set up a Web Application Firewall with rules to block suspicious and malicious requests. Patch Patch and upgrade any platforms and software timely and make it into a standard security policy. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities and zero-days. Secure Coding Along with network and system hardening, code hardening should be implemented within the organization so that their websites and software are secure. Use testing tools to detect any vulnerabilities in the deployed codes. 2FA Enable two-factor authentication. Antivirus Enable antivirus and anti-malware software and update signature definitions in a timely manner. Using a multi-layered protection is necessary to secure vulnerable assets Security Best Practices Do not open emails and attachments from unknown or suspicious sources. Upgrade to the latest version of WordPress, available from the WordPress Plugin Directory."}
