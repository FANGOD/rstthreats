The commit was not flagged as a security issue and therefore the patch was not backported in most Android kernels. At the time of the exploit, all Samsung kernels were vulnerable; LTS kernels running on Pixel phones were recent enough and included the fix for this bug. Unfortunately, this is not the first time we have seen this happen with exploits in the wild; the 2019 Bad Binder vulnerability is another example. In both cases, the fix was not flagged as a security issue and thus not backported to all (or any) Android kernels. Attackers are actively looking for and profiting from such slowly-fixed vulnerabilities."

The commit was not flagged as a security issue and therefore the patch was not backported in most Android kernels. At the time of the exploit, all Samsung kernels were vulnerable; LTS kernels running on Pixel phones were recent enough and included the fix for this bug. Unfortunately, this is not the first time we have seen this happen with exploits in the wild; the 2019 Bad Binder vulnerability is another example. In both cases, the fix was not flagged as a security issue and thus not backported to all (or any) Android kernels. Attackers are actively looking for and profiting from such slowly-fixed vulnerabilities.",

The commit was not flagged as a security issue and therefore the patch was not backported in most Android kernels. At the time of the exploit, all Samsung kernels were vulnerable; LTS kernels running on Pixel phones were recent enough and included the fix for this bug. Unfortunately, this is not the first time we have seen this happen with exploits in the wild; the 2019 Bad Binder vulnerability is another example. In both cases, the fix was not flagged as a security issue and thus not backported to all (or any) Android kernels. Attackers are actively looking for and profiting from such slowly-fixed vulnerabilities."
