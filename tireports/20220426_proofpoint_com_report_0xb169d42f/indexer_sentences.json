Proofpoint assesses that the threat group distributing Emotet is likely testing new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) on a small scale before adopting them in broader campaigns or to deploy them in parallel with the broad campaigns. The messages contained OneDrive URLs that hosted a zip archive containing XLL files dropping Emotet malware. This activity is attributed to TA542."}

In February, Microsoft announced it would begin blocking Visual Basic for Application (VBA) macros obtained from the internet by default in April. This follows Microsofts announcement to disable XL4 macros in 2021. Typically, threat actors including TA542 that use macro-enabled attachments rely on social engineering to convince a recipient the content is trustworthy, and enabling macros is necessary to view it."}
