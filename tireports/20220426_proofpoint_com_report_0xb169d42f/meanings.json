This particular archive contained four copies of the same XLL file with names such as Salary_and_bonuses-04.01.2022.xll.

Emotet has since resumed its high-volume campaigns. Proofpoint researchers assess that while on the break, TA542 continued development and testing of new attack vectors, specifically OneDrive URLs and XLL files, in preparation for using them on a wider scale. Alternatively, these new TTPs may indicate that TA542 may now be engaged in more selective and limited scale attacks in parallel to the typical mass scale email campaigns."

Emotet has since resumed its high-volume campaigns. Proofpoint researchers assess that while on the break, TA542 continued development and testing of new attack vectors, specifically OneDrive URLs and XLL files, in preparation for using them on a wider scale.

In February, Microsoft announced it would begin blocking Visual Basic for Application (VBA) macros obtained from the internet by default in April. This follows Microsofts announcement to disable XL4 macros in 2021. Typically, threat actors including TA542 that use macro-enabled attachments rely on social engineering to convince a recipient the content is trustworthy, and enabling macros is necessary to view it."
