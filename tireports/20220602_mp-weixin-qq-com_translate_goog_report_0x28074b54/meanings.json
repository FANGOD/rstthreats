The backdoor design idea is similar to APT32's \"Double-headed Dragon\" and MacOS backdoor. This backdoor also has structured traffic. The technical characteristics of a single process instance, information collection, and C2 encoding are almost the same as those of the \"Double-headed Dragon\", but the instruction types are different, and the traffic encryption method is relatively simple. The information collection uses the commands \"/dev/disk/by-uuid/\" and \"cat /etc/*release | uniq\" to extract the prefixes of the words By and uniq, and name it Buni.<crlf>At first analysts thought Buni was the predecessor of the \"Double-headed Dragon\", a weapon no longer used by APT32, but recently it was discovered that this Linux backdoor is active again. The hard-coded C2 in the Buni backdoor utilizes some compromised IoT devices and controls a large number of hosts. The hard-coded C2 in the Buni historical sample file has been used for 2.5 years. As of 2022, some Buni samples have maintained 0 antivirus detection results on the VT platform for two full years; as of the latest time, only two antivirus detections have been detected.",
                        "\"Ocean Lotus\", also known as APT32 and OceanLotus, is a hacker group from Southeast Asia. The organization has been active since at least 2012, and has long targeted China's energy industry, maritime agencies, border defense agencies, health departments, maritime construction departments, scientific research institutes, and shipping companies. In addition to China, the targets of \"Ocean Lotus\" also include governments, military agencies and large enterprises around the world, as well as domestic media, human rights and civil society related organizations and individuals.",
                        "The Weibu Intelligence Bureau is composed of senior experts who are proficient in Trojan analysis and forensics technology, Web attack technology, traceability technology, big data, AI and other security technologies. Through automated intelligence production system, cloud sandbox, hacker portrait system, threat hunting system, Tracking traceability system, threat perception system, big data correlation knowledge graph and other self-developed systems, conduct real-time automatic analysis and homology of millions of sample files, tens of millions of URLs, PDNS, and Whois data newly added by Weibu Online every day. Analysis and big data correlation analysis. Since its establishment, the Weibu Intelligence Bureau has been the first to discover targeted attacks by dozens of foreign advanced APT organizations against my country's key infrastructure and industries such as finance, energy, government, and high-tech, assisting hundreds of leading customers in various industries. He has dealt with the WannaCry extortion incident that ravaged the world, the BlackTech targeted attack on my country's securities and high-tech incidents, the long-term targeted attack on my country's maritime/high-tech/finance by OceanLotus, and the OldFox targeted attack on hundreds of companies in the mobile phone industry across the country.",
                        "In historical attack methods, APT32 has been trying different methods to execute malicious code on target systems and bypass security detection. In the long-term research and confrontation of APT32 by the Weibu Intelligence Bureau, an undisclosed Linux backdoor \"Buni\" of APT32 was captured in the second half of last year, and under the continuous monitoring of the threat hunting system, it was found that it has become active again recently.",

                        "2<crlf>Details<crlf>In the process of investigating APT32's assets in 2021, the Weibu Intelligence Bureau found another undisclosed Linux backdoor of APT32. The backdoor design idea is similar to APT32's \"Double-headed Dragon\" and MacOS backdoor. This backdoor also has structured traffic. The technical characteristics of a single process instance, information collection, and C2 encoding are almost the same as those of the \"Double-headed Dragon\", but the instruction types are different, and the traffic encryption method is relatively simple. The information collection uses the commands \"/dev/disk/by-uuid/\" and \"cat /etc/*release | uniq\" to extract the prefixes of the words By and uniq, and name it Buni.<crlf>At first analysts thought Buni was the predecessor of the \"Double-headed Dragon\", a weapon no longer used by APT32, but recently it was discovered that this Linux backdoor is active again. The hard-coded C2 in the Buni backdoor utilizes some compromised IoT devices and controls a large number of hosts. The hard-coded C2 in the Buni historical sample file has been used for 2.5 years. As of 2022, some Buni samples have maintained 0 antivirus detection results on the VT platform for two full years; as of the latest time, only two antivirus detections have been detected."

The backdoor design idea is similar to APT32's \"Double-headed Dragon\" and MacOS backdoor. This backdoor also has structured traffic. The technical characteristics of a single process instance, information collection, and C2 encoding are almost the same as those of the \"Double-headed Dragon\", but the instruction types are different, and the traffic encryption method is relatively simple. The information collection uses the commands \"/dev/disk/by-uuid/\" and \"cat /etc/*release | uniq\" to extract the prefixes of the words By and uniq, and name it Buni.<crlf>At first analysts thought Buni was the predecessor of the \"Double-headed Dragon\", a weapon no longer used by APT32, but recently it was discovered that this Linux backdoor is active again. The hard-coded C2 in the Buni backdoor utilizes some compromised IoT devices and controls a large number of hosts. The hard-coded C2 in the Buni historical sample file has been used for 2.5 years. As of 2022, some Buni samples have maintained 0 antivirus detection results on the VT platform for two full years; as of the latest time, only two antivirus detections have been detected."
