Several threat actors that typically use BazaLoader in malware campaigns have transitioned to Bumblebee. BazaLoader has not been seen in Proofpoint data since February 2022. Bumblebee is in active development and wields elaborate evasion techniques to include complex anti-virtualization. Unlike most other malware that uses process hollowing or DLL injection, this loader utilizes an asynchronous procedure call (APC) injection to start the shellcode from the commands received from the command and control (C2). Proofpoint observed Bumblebee dropping Cobalt Strike, shellcode, Sliver, and Meterpreter. Threat actors using Bumblebee are associated with malware payloads that have been linked to follow-on ransomware campaigns."}
