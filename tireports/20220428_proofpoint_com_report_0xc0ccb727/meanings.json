Unlike most other malware, Bumblebee currently has its configuration stored in plaintext, but Proofpoint suspects that obfuscation may be added in the future. With the group ID copied, the loader resolves addresses for various NTDLL functions that allow it to properly perform injection later in the loading process.",

The loader starts with copying over the group ID which is effectively used as botnet identifier. Unlike most other malware, Bumblebee currently has its configuration stored in plaintext, but Proofpoint suspects that obfuscation may be added in the future. With the group ID copied, the loader resolves addresses for various NTDLL functions that allow it to properly perform injection later in the loading process."
