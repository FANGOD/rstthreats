<p>High</p>
<h2>Analysis Summary</h2>
<p>DCRat – a Russian backdoor, was initially introduced in 2018, but rebuilt and relaunched a year later. The DCRat backdoor appears to be the product of a single threat actor who goes online with the pseudonyms of “boldenis44,” “crystalcoder,” and Кодер (“Coder”). </p>
<p>DCRat is one of the cheapest commercial RATs. For a two-month membership, the price starts at 500 RUB (less than 5 GBP/US$6), and it periodically drops even cheaper during special offers. This is written in .NET and features a modular structure, allowing affiliates to create their own plugins using DCRat Studio, a dedicated integrated development environment (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a>).</p>
<p>The malware’s modular architecture allows it to be extended for a variety of nefarious objectives, including surveillance, reconnaissance, data theft, DDoS attacks, and arbitrary code execution.</p>
<p>The DCRat consists of <a href="https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/05/dirty-deeds-done-dirt-cheap-russian-rat-offers-backdoor-bargains">three</a> parts:</p>
<ul><li>A stealer/client executable</li><li>The command-and-control (C2) endpoint/ interface is a single PHP page</li><li>An administrator tool</li></ul>
<p>The malware is still in development, the author announces any news and updates through a dedicated Telegram channel with about 3k users updated with any news and changes.</p>
