                        "One of these banking trojans that have been used to deploy ransomware is IcedID (BokBot). IcedID was first reported on by IBM X-Force in November 2017 and the malware shared some code with Pony. While initially designed to steal banking credentials, like many other banking trojans, the malware has been repurposed for deploying other malware on the infected machines.",
                        "icedID",
                        "In the new IcedID campaign we have discovered a further evolution of the threat actors technique. The threat actor now uses compromised Microsoft Exchange servers to send the phishing emails from the account that they stole from. The payload has also moved away from using office documents to the use of ISO files with a Windows LNK file and a DLL file. The use of ISO files allows the threat actor to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web controls, resulting in execution of the malware without warning to the user. With regards to targeting, we have seen organizations within energy, healthcare, law, and pharmaceutical sectors.",
                        "This post describes the technical analysis of a new campaign detected by Intezers research team, which initiates attacks with a phishing email that uses conversation hijacking to deliver IcedID.",
                        "In June 2021, Proofpoint released a report on different access brokers that facilitates access for ransomware groups. Of the different threat actors, according to Proofpoint, two of them (TA577 and TA551) used IcedID as their malware. The techniques used by TA551 include conversation hijacking and password protected zip files. The group is also known to use regsvr32.exe for signed binary proxy execution for malicious DLLs.",
                        "The use of regsvr32 allows for proxy execution of malicious code in main.dll for defense evasion. The DLL file is a loader for the IcedID payload. It contains a number of exports, most of which consist of junk code.",
                        "The IcedID Gziploader payload is decoded and placed in memory and then executed. GZiploader fingerprints the machine and sends a beacon to the command and control server with information about the infected host. The information is smuggled through the cookies header via an HTTP GET request.",
                        "One way IcedID infects machines is via phishing emails. The infection chain that commonly has been used is an email with an attached password protected zip archive. Inside the archive is a macro enabled office document that executes the IcedID installer. Some phishing emails reuse previously stolen emails to make the lure more convincing."

MAPI is a protocol used (for example, by Outlook) to access the mailbox on an Exchange server. This suggests that the threat actor used an Exchange client instead of using SMTP to send the email. We have also seen the header X-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook 16.0 in multiple phishing emails. In other phishing emails a X-Originating-IP header can be found. This is a header added by the Exchange server when the web interface is used. The IP address in the header is that of the client that connected to the server. We have observed both hosting providers and non-commercial IP addresses for the client IP.",

The threat actor now uses compromised Microsoft Exchange servers to send the phishing emails from the account that they stole from. The payload has also moved away from using office documents to the use of ISO files with a Windows LNK file and a DLL file. The use of ISO files allows the threat actor to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web controls, resulting in execution of the malware without warning to the user. With regards to targeting, we have seen organizations within energy, healthcare, law, and pharmaceutical sectors.",

It is important to be able to detect malicious files in memory to detect this type of attack. We recommend you use an endpoint scanner.",

Normally email messages are stolen during an infection and used in future attacks to make the phishing email appear more legitimate. In the last six months, threat actors have evolved the technique further to make it even more convincing. Instead of sending the stolen conversation to the victim with a spoofed email address, threat actors are now using the email address of the victim that they stole the original email from to make the phishing email even more convincing.",

The threat actor now uses compromised Microsoft Exchange servers to send the phishing emails from the account that they stole from. The payload has also moved away from using office documents to the use of ISO files with a Windows LNK file and a DLL file. The use of ISO files allows the threat actor to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web controls, resulting in execution of the malware without warning to the user.

In the last six months, threat actors have evolved the technique further to make it even more convincing.
