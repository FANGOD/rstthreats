Like the other Transparent Tribe variants, in this VBA script it creates a new directory E0d1 under C:\\ProgramData\\ and writes the array of values from the VBA into a file Chairtabkjh.zip in that directory. The zip file contains the executable file named Chairtabkjh8.exe which is extracted in the same path. The extracted file adds a startup entry to run in the background as a child process of the word document.",
                        "Recently we came across a Twitter feed that described a Transparent Tribe malware sample targeting Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Hyderabad and the sample was fairly new and did not have many detections (at the time of writing this blog) which attracted our interest in diving deeper into the sample.",
                        "Since we already know Transparent Tribe uses RAT, this sample that is being analyzed may also use some of these common malicious behaviors of RAT like",
                        "In 2019, we in K7 Labs published an article about Transparent Tribe targeting the CLAWS, a security think tank team affiliated with the Indian Army. Recently similar kinds of attacks have been happening more frequently, targeting state governments and other government institutions. Transparent Tribe recently targeted the West Bengal government employees by sending a spoofed document (of a legitimate government document) which delivers a Crimson RAT payload. Our sample of interest now, also delivers a document pretending to be a legitimate survey form by IIT Hyderabad. Once the document is opened, it asks the user to enable a macro through which it can run the VBA script.",
                        "Transparent Tribe aka APT36 or Mythic Leopard is suspected to be of Pakistani origin and primarily targets Indian government and military entities, as per public reports . Transparent Tribe has been active since 2013 and has targeted government organizations in around 30 countries. Their usual attack sequence is to create fake domains mimicking the government organization and then deliver the payload. It frequently uses Crimson RAT, a Windows based Remote Admin Tool which provides unauthorized access to a victims device over a network."

Transparent Tribe recently targeted the West Bengal government employees by sending a spoofed document (of a legitimate government document) which delivers a Crimson RAT payload. Our sample of interest now, also delivers a document pretending to be a legitimate survey form by IIT Hyderabad. Once the document is opened, it asks the user to enable a macro through which it can run the VBA script.",

Transparent Tribe has been active since 2013 and has targeted government organizations in around 30 countries. Their usual attack sequence is to create fake domains mimicking the government organization and then deliver the payload. It frequently uses Crimson RAT, a Windows based Remote Admin Tool which provides unauthorized access to a victims device over a network."

Recently similar kinds of attacks have been happening more frequently, targeting state governments and other government institutions. Transparent Tribe recently targeted the West Bengal government employees by sending a spoofed document (of a legitimate government document) which delivers a Crimson RAT payload. Our sample of interest now, also delivers a document pretending to be a legitimate survey form by IIT Hyderabad. Once the document is opened, it asks the user to enable a macro through which it can run the VBA script.",
                        "Transparent Tribe aka APT36 or Mythic Leopard is suspected to be of Pakistani origin and primarily targets Indian government and military entities, as per public reports . Transparent Tribe has been active since 2013 and has targeted government organizations in around 30 countries. Their usual attack sequence is to create fake domains mimicking the government organization and then deliver the payload. It frequently uses Crimson RAT, a Windows based Remote Admin Tool which provides unauthorized access to a victims device over a network."
