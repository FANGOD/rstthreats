That sample has the same networking features as Colibri which helps us ascertain with more confidence that the technique was debuted by Colibri.",
                        "Our Threat Intelligence Team recently uncovered a new Colibri Loader campaign delivering the Vidar Stealer as final payload. There is already published material about Colibri by CloudSek and independent researchers. Since most of the details about the bot have been covered, we decided to highlight a persistence technique we havent seen before.",
                        "The macro enables PowerShell to download the final payload (Colibri Loader) as setup.exe:",
                        "In the first scenario (Win7), we see a task pointing to the path of Colibri Loader. However, in the second we see an odd task to execute PowerShell with a hidden window. This is what we believe is a new persistence technique employed by the malware author.",
                        "The attack starts with a malicious Word document deploying Colibri bot that then delivers the Vidar Stealer. The document contacts a remote server at (securetunnel[.]co) to load a remote template named trkal0.dot that contacts a malicious macro. This attack is known as remote template injection.",
                        "Colibri is still in its infancy but it already offers many features for attackers and slowly seems to be gaining popularity. The persistence technique we outlined in this blog is simple but efficient and does not appear to be known.",
                        "Colibri Loader is a relatively new piece of malware that first appeared on underground forums in August 2021 and was advertised to people who have large volumes of traffic and lack of time to work out the material. As it names suggests, it is meant to deliver and manage payloads onto infected computers.",
                        "We discovered an interesting trick used by Colibri Loader to survive reboots that takes advantage of a legitimate command in PowerShell.",
                        "Colibri leverages PowerShell in a unique way to maintain persistence after a reboot. Depending on the Windows version, Colibri drops its copy in %APPDATA%\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps and names it Get-Variable.exe for Windows 10 and above, while for lower versions it drops it in %DOCUMENTS%/WindowsPowerShell named as dllhost.exe",
