            "text": "Posted: April 5, 2022 by Threat Intelligence Team\nWe discovered an interesting trick used by Colibri Loader to survive reboots that takes advantage of a legitimate command in PowerShell.\nThis blog post was authored by Ankur Saini, with contributions from Hossein Jazi and Jrme Segura\nColibri Loader is a relatively new piece of malware that first appeared on underground forums in August 2021 and was advertised to people who have large volumes of traffic and lack of time to work out the material. As it names suggests, it is meant to deliver and manage payloads onto infected computers.\nOur Threat Intelligence Team recently uncovered a new Colibri Loader campaign delivering the Vidar Stealer as final payload. There is already published material about Colibri by CloudSek and independent researchers. Since most of the details about the bot have been covered, we decided to highlight a persistence technique we havent seen before."

            "text": "Colibri leverages PowerShell in a unique way to maintain persistence after a reboot. Depending on the Windows version, Colibri drops its copy in %APPDATA%\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps and names it Get-Variable.exe for Windows 10 and above, while for lower versions it drops it in %DOCUMENTS%/WindowsPowerShell named as dllhost.exe\nOn Windows 7, it creates a scheduled task using the following command:\nschtasks.exe /create /tn COMSurrogate /st 00:00 /du 9999:59 /sc once /ri 1 /f /tr C:\\Users\\admin\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\dllhost.exe\nOn Windows 10 and above, it creates a scheduled task using the following command:\nschtasks.exe /create /tn COMSurrogate /st 00:00 /du 9999:59 /sc once /ri 1 /f /tr powershell.exe -windowstyle hidden\nIn the first scenario (Win7), we see a task pointing to the path of Colibri Loader. However, in the second we see an odd task to execute PowerShell with a hidden window. This is what we believe is a new persistence technique employed by the malware author.\nAs mentioned earlier, it drops the file with the name Get-Variable.exe in the WindowsApps directory. It so happens that Get-Variable is a valid PowerShell cmdlet (a cmdlet is a lightweight command used in the Windows PowerShell environment) which is used to retrieve the value of a variable in the current console.\nAdditionally, WindowsApps is by default in the path where PowerShell is executed. So when the Get-Variable command is issued on PowerShell execution, the system first looks for the Get-Variable executable in the path and executes the malicious binary instead of looking for the PowerShell cmdlet.\nWe reproduced this technique using the calculator to show how an adversary can easily achieve persistence combining a scheduled task and any payload (as long as it is called Get-Variable.exe and placed in the proper location):\nA search on VirusTotal for the file name Get-Variable.exe indicates that the first malicious file uploaded to the platform happened last August, which matches with the time that Colibri appeared on XSS underground forums. That sample has the same networking features as Colibri which helps us ascertain with more confidence that the technique was debuted by Colibri."
