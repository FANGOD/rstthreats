Source: GitHub<crlf>In this incident, AsyncRAT was delivered via an email containing several layers of files to evade email filtering defenses. The first layer, a randomly named HTML file was retrieved by the user and opened in their browser. The user was prompted to download an embedded ISO file, a defense evasion technique known as HTML smuggling. The ISO file was mounted by the victim, revealing an embedded VBS script file. The VBS file was clicked by the user, resulting in PowerShell execution to retrieve a script from a remote host.Figure 2 PowerShell Dropper<crlf>The first layer, a randomly named HTML file was retrieved by the user and opened in their browser.

Source: GitHub<crlf>In this incident, AsyncRAT was delivered via an email containing several layers of files to evade email filtering defenses. The first layer, a randomly named HTML file was retrieved by the user and opened in their browser. The user was prompted to download an embedded ISO file, a defense evasion technique known as HTML smuggling. The ISO file was mounted by the victim, revealing an embedded VBS script file. The VBS file was clicked by the user, resulting in PowerShell execution to retrieve a script from a remote host.Figure 2 PowerShell Dropper<crlf>The first layer, a randomly named HTML file was retrieved by the user and opened in their browser.
