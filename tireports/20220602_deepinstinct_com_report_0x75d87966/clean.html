actor is known to exploit Fortinet CVE-2018-13379, Exchange ProxyShell, and the log4j vulnerabilities.</p><p>Our analysis indicated that PHOSPHORUS continues in its automated scanning and exploitation process in order to widely gain access to multiple vulnerable organizations.</p><p>Furthermore, we found that the actor is continuously changing <a href="#" target="_self">its</a> payload and infrastructure and discovered a new evasion technique used by PHOSPHORUS to conceal their malicious traffic and mislead security teams.</p><p>Thanks to Deep Instinct’s prevention capabilities the threat actor was unsuccessful in executing the payloads in a customer environment despite successful exploitation of the Exchange server.</p><p>If you’d like to see the platform in action for yourself, we’d be honored to <a href="https://info.deepinstinct.com/request-a-demo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">show you</a> what true prevention looks like.</p><h2>IOC</h2><table><thead
