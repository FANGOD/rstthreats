                                        <li>. One more campaign was discovered later in the year.<br/><br/>After the first attacks, it became clear that OldGremlin prepares their phishing emails with great care and monitors the news agenda closely. Their choices for email subjects included remote work during the pandemic, protests in Belarus, and an interview request from a known financial journalist working for a Russian media outlet, called RBC.<br/>Another OldGremlin hallmark is that the group conducts multi-stage targeted attacks using sophisticated tactics and techniques. For example, they did not send their TinyCryptor ransomware directly by email; instead they first obtained remote access to the victim's machine. The latter was used as a springboard to conduct reconnaissance, collect data, and then move laterally across the organization's network.<br/>OldGremlin launched only one mass phishing email campaign in 2021 (in February), but it was so successful that, apparently, it fueled the gang for the entire year. A few months later, Group-IB team discovered that the February email campaign was the initial entry point and source of a number of attacks. Moreover, last year OldGremlin became the greediest cybergang targeting Russia: they demanded as much as $3 million from one of their victims.<br/><br/>In late March 2022, OldGremlin put themselves on the radar with two malicious email campaigns. As in past attacks, the group bombarded Russian companies with another batch of emails exploiting trending news topics. This time they played the sanctions card, masquerading as representatives of a Russian financial organization.<br/>Given the fact that many international providers of email security products suspended operations on the Russian market, the campaigns of OldGremlin and other threat actors that use email at the initial stage are likely to become more successful and frequent.<br/>Having identified one potential victim (a mining company), Group-IB Computer Emergency Response team (CERT-GIB) warned the company in question about the threat.<br/>In this blog post, Group-IB experts share technical descriptions of OldGremlin's new attacks and tools and map the group's main tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.</li>

Source: Group-IB Threat Intelligence<br/><br/>As mentioned above, carefully crafted phishing emails are OldGremlin's hallmark. This time the emails were allegedly sent by a senior accountant of a financial organization in Russia who warned the recipients about new sanctions that would completely suspend operations of Visa/Mastercard payment systems. Notably, the phishing emails were sent two weeks after Visa and Mastercard</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Three days later, on March 25, the group launched a new campaign, but using a more simplified toolkit. The likely reason for this is that the final script used in the previous attack was not yet ready for full-fledged use in the wild. It required additional testing and additional features. The bad news is that OldGremlin will most likely perfect their script and use it in future attacks.<br/>Unfortunately, Group-IB has not yet uncovered any email samples (if you have received one, please let us know), but our specialists did reconstruct the second attack.</li>

The campaign affected multiple companies, and OldGremlin is still reaping the benefits, as they are known for dwelling in the victims' infrastructure for a long time before proceeding to the next stage.<br/><br/>To return to the recent attack, the infection scheme is presented below for clarity:</li>

                                        <li>OldGremlin's phishing email from the March 22 campaign<br/><br/>Translation of the phishing email:<br/>Hello,<br/>We, at [masked], have received reliable information about new sanctions that will be imposed in the next couple of days. The Visa/Mastercard payment system will be shut down completely.

TinyFluff is a successor to the gang's custom backdoor called TinyNode, which OldGremlin used as the primary downloader for receiving and running malicious scripts. The purpose of TinyFluff was to launch the interpreter Node.js on the infected device and grant remote access to it (a detailed description of the interpreter can be found in the "Tools" section).<br/><br/>The key features of this version of TinyFluff are:</li>

Group-IB discovered two LNK files that were associated with the IP address 46.101.113[.]161 (used to resolve NS records for subdomains from the previous malicious email campaign). Both files were located in archives available for downloading from Dropbox:</li>

The year 2020 was the most fruitful: ten campaigns, with emails purporting to be from a Russian metallurgical holding, the Belarusian plant MTZ, a dental clinic, and the media holding RBC, nine of which were described in</li>

Before the campaign, on March 2, the attackers registered the domain mirfinance[.]org with namecheap, set it up with the public email service Yandex.Mail and sent malicious emails to Russian companies. The use of public legitimate email service sometimes allows the attackers to bypass traditional security systems.</li>

                                        <li>. One more campaign was discovered later in the year.<br/><br/>After the first attacks, it became clear that OldGremlin prepares their phishing emails with great care and monitors the news agenda closely. Their choices for email subjects included remote work during the pandemic, protests in Belarus, and an interview request from a known financial journalist working for a Russian media outlet, called RBC.<br/>Another OldGremlin hallmark is that the group conducts multi-stage targeted attacks using sophisticated tactics and techniques. For example, they did not send their TinyCryptor ransomware directly by email; instead they first obtained remote access to the victim's machine. The latter was used as a springboard to conduct reconnaissance, collect data, and then move laterally across the organization's network.<br/>OldGremlin launched only one mass phishing email campaign in 2021 (in February), but it was so successful that, apparently, it fueled the gang for the entire year. A few months later, Group-IB team discovered that the February email campaign was the initial entry point and source of a number of attacks. Moreover, last year OldGremlin became the greediest cybergang targeting Russia: they demanded as much as $3 million from one of their victims.<br/><br/>In late March 2022, OldGremlin put themselves on the radar with two malicious email campaigns. As in past attacks, the group bombarded Russian companies with another batch of emails exploiting trending news topics. This time they played the sanctions card, masquerading as representatives of a Russian financial organization.<br/>Given the fact that many international providers of email security products suspended operations on the Russian market, the campaigns of OldGremlin and other threat actors that use email at the initial stage are likely to become more successful and frequent.<br/>Having identified one potential victim (a mining company), Group-IB Computer Emergency Response team (CERT-GIB) warned the company in question about the threat.<br/>In this blog post, Group-IB experts share technical descriptions of OldGremlin's new attacks and tools and map the group's main tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.</li>

                                        <li>. One more campaign was discovered later in the year.<br/><br/>After the first attacks, it became clear that OldGremlin prepares their phishing emails with great care and monitors the news agenda closely. Their choices for email subjects included remote work during the pandemic, protests in Belarus, and an interview request from a known financial journalist working for a Russian media outlet, called RBC.<br/>Another OldGremlin hallmark is that the group conducts multi-stage targeted attacks using sophisticated tactics and techniques. For example, they did not send their TinyCryptor ransomware directly by email; instead they first obtained remote access to the victim's machine. The latter was used as a springboard to conduct reconnaissance, collect data, and then move laterally across the organization's network.<br/>OldGremlin launched only one mass phishing email campaign in 2021 (in February), but it was so successful that, apparently, it fueled the gang for the entire year. A few months later, Group-IB team discovered that the February email campaign was the initial entry point and source of a number of attacks. Moreover, last year OldGremlin became the greediest cybergang targeting Russia: they demanded as much as $3 million from one of their victims.<br/><br/>In late March 2022, OldGremlin put themselves on the radar with two malicious email campaigns. As in past attacks, the group bombarded Russian companies with another batch of emails exploiting trending news topics. This time they played the sanctions card, masquerading as representatives of a Russian financial organization.<br/>Given the fact that many international providers of email security products suspended operations on the Russian market, the campaigns of OldGremlin and other threat actors that use email at the initial stage are likely to become more successful and frequent.<br/>Having identified one potential victim (a mining company), Group-IB Computer Emergency Response team (CERT-GIB) warned the company in question about the threat.<br/>In this blog post, Group-IB experts share technical descriptions of OldGremlin's new attacks and tools and map the group's main tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.</li>

The decoy documents looked as follows:</li>

To view or edit the document, click on the "Enable content" button on the top yellow stripe.<br/>It is noteworthy that in February 2021, the threat actor sent emails leveraging a malicious document containing a similar Office 365 image. The campaign affected multiple companies, and OldGremlin is still reaping the benefits, as they are known for dwelling in the victims' infrastructure for a long time before proceeding to the next stage.<br/><br/>To return to the recent attack, the infection scheme is presented below for clarity:</li>

Groups that violated the rule were few and far between, and OldGremlin was one of them. Since spring 2020, when the "gremlins" were first</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The above described algorithm is used to de-obfuscate all traffic between the malware and the C2 server, with only the key changing (going forward we will therefore only say that the data is de-obfuscated using a given key). After de-obfuscation, a JS script is immediately executed by the interpreter. The textual description is complicated, so let's illustrate it using a sample analyzed by the THF Polygon. Registration looked as follows:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>OldGremlin's phishing email from the March 22 campaign<br/><br/>Translation of the phishing email:<br/>Hello,<br/>We, at [masked], have received reliable information about new sanctions that will be imposed in the next couple of days. The Visa/Mastercard payment system will be shut down completely. All cards issued in our country will no longer work.<br/>Everyone must therefore urgently issue [masked] cards and link them to their bank payroll.<br/>Use the following instructions [hyperlink] for the following banks: [masked]<br/>Fill out the form (see attachment) and send it back, making sure to specify the bank branch at which it is convenient for you to pick up the bank card.<br/>Remember that if you want to link a card to a payroll, you must inform the accounting department of the account details after receiving the card.<br/>Please sign and send the form to our email address within 5 (five) hours from the moment you receive this email. For the purposes of efficiency, please send it in this email thread chain.<br/>[masked],<br/>Senior Accountant at [masked]<br/><br/>To have a new payment card "issued", the client was supposed to read the guidelines and fill out a questionnaire. In reality, the emails contained links to a malicious document stored in Dropbox: hxxps://dl[.]dropboxusercontent[.]com/s/1956cypkkihawuu/Anketa.docx?dl=0. The document looked as follows:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>As seen in the screenshot, the argument of the second node.exe process is a script without obfuscation. Its functionality is simple: it connects to the address 46.101.113[.]161:80, passes the format identifier /{0.[0-9]*/}, receives the command in a loop, and executes it (using the function eval). The commands are described in detail in the relevant section.<br/>Although the second version of TinyFluff (SHA1: bd0a6a3628f268a37ac9d708d03f57feef5ed55e) was discovered earlier (and the compilation date is more recent), it is more sophisticated. Just like the previous version, it places the script and the interpreter in the directory %APPDATA%\%MachineGuid%. However, the interpreter is downloaded from the official website: http://nodejs.org/dist/latest-erbium/win-x86/node.exe, and the malicious script is located in a resource of the executable file named TXT. As in the above case, the de-obfuscated script can be obtained from an argument of the node.exe child process:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The archive contained the group's new tool, which judging by the PDB string the developer named TinyFluff. TinyFluff is a successor to the gang's custom backdoor called TinyNode, which OldGremlin used as the primary downloader for receiving and running malicious scripts. The purpose of TinyFluff was to launch the interpreter Node.js on the infected device and grant remote access to it (a detailed description of the interpreter can be found in the "Tools" section).<br/><br/>The key features of this version of TinyFluff are:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Let's begin with the tf.exe file (SHA1: c82e12e563d5d5f4a8dd67703b5df7373b457abc) as the tool is much simpler than its predecessor. Once launched, the application creates the directory %APPDATA%\%MachineGuid%, where %MachineGuid% is the registry value for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\MachineGuid. If the directory already exists, the application terminates itself. The application copies the interpreter Node.js (node.exe) and the malicious script s.txt to the created directory. The script is heavily obfuscated, but if it can be run then there is no need to waste time on de-obfuscation because the obfuscated layer restarts Node.js and passes a "clean" script to it as an argument.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>OldGremlin's March 25 attack<br/><br/>The attack was identified following the analysis of OldGremlin's infrastructure. Group-IB discovered two LNK files that were associated with the IP address 46.101.113[.]161 (used to resolve NS records for subdomains from the previous malicious email campaign). Both files were located in archives available for downloading from Dropbox:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>by Group-IB Threat Intelligence analysts, the hackers have been attacking Russian businesses, including banks, industrial enterprises, medical organizations, and software developers.<br/>According to a Singapore-based cybersecurity company Group-IB, over the past two years OldGremlin has conducted 13 malicious email campaigns. The year 2020 was the most fruitful: ten campaigns, with emails purporting to be from a Russian metallurgical holding, the Belarusian plant MTZ, a dental clinic, and the media holding RBC, nine of which were described in</li>
                                    
                                        <li>A new OldGremlin's attack was detected on March 22, 2022. Before the campaign, on March 2, the attackers registered the domain mirfinance[.]org with namecheap, set it up with the public email service Yandex.Mail and sent malicious emails to Russian companies. The use of public legitimate email service sometimes allows the attackers to bypass traditional security systems.</li>

                                        <li>. One more campaign was discovered later in the year.<br/><br/>After the first attacks, it became clear that OldGremlin prepares their phishing emails with great care and monitors the news agenda closely. Their choices for email subjects included remote work during the pandemic, protests in Belarus, and an interview request from a known financial journalist working for a Russian media outlet, called RBC.<br/>Another OldGremlin hallmark is that the group conducts multi-stage targeted attacks using sophisticated tactics and techniques. For example, they did not send their TinyCryptor ransomware directly by email; instead they first obtained remote access to the victim's machine. The latter was used as a springboard to conduct reconnaissance, collect data, and then move laterally across the organization's network.<br/>OldGremlin launched only one mass phishing email campaign in 2021 (in February), but it was so successful that, apparently, it fueled the gang for the entire year. A few months later, Group-IB team discovered that the February email campaign was the initial entry point and source of a number of attacks. Moreover, last year OldGremlin became the greediest cybergang targeting Russia: they demanded as much as $3 million from one of their victims.<br/><br/>In late March 2022, OldGremlin put themselves on the radar with two malicious email campaigns. As in past attacks, the group bombarded Russian companies with another batch of emails exploiting trending news topics. This time they played the sanctions card, masquerading as representatives of a Russian financial organization.<br/>Given the fact that many international providers of email security products suspended operations on the Russian market, the campaigns of OldGremlin and other threat actors that use email at the initial stage are likely to become more successful and frequent.<br/>Having identified one potential victim (a mining company), Group-IB Computer Emergency Response team (CERT-GIB) warned the company in question about the threat.<br/>In this blog post, Group-IB experts share technical descriptions of OldGremlin's new attacks and tools and map the group's main tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.</li>

The Visa/Mastercard payment system will be shut down completely. All cards issued in our country will no longer work.<br/>Everyone must therefore urgently issue [masked] cards and link them to their bank payroll.<br/>Use the following instructions [hyperlink] for the following banks: [masked]<br/>Fill out the form (see attachment) and send it back, making sure to specify the bank branch at which it is convenient for you to pick up the bank card.<br/>Remember that if you want to link a card to a payroll, you must inform the accounting department of the account details after receiving the card.<br/>Please sign and send the form to our email address within 5 (five) hours from the moment you receive this email.

                                        <li>As can be seen, the first command is designed to download and run the next-stage tool. To do so, it performs 23 DNS queries (such as 0x%chank_number%.lin9gtmn.eccbc8[.]com), concatenates the responses into a string, de-obfuscates it using the key lin9gtmn, and launches it. An example of such requests:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The resulting script has many functions, including:<br/>Sending multiple DNS queries at the same time<br/>Gathering information about infected devices<br/>Stealing files from infected devices<br/>Downloading arbitrary files from servers<br/>Deploying a SOCKS server to proxy traffic</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Communication with the C2 server through a DNS tunnel<br/>Gathering information about infected devices<br/>Stealing files from infected devices<br/>Downloading arbitrary files from servers<br/>Deploying a SOCKS server to proxy traffic<br/>Executing arbitrary JS code</li>
                                    
                                        <li>For each domain, the script generates a subdomain in the format [0-9a-f]{4}.[0-9a-f]{8}.%dga_domain%, creates a DNS query, and receives a TXT record. The tool carries out all communication through a DNS tunnel, which means that all the data transmitted by the Trojan is in a subdomain and the server's response is in a TXT record. We will not dwell on this any further as we believe that all interaction with the server occurs in this way.<br/>The script verifies the digital signature of the received data using the function crypto.verify with the base64-encoded key MCowBQYDK2VwAyEAgp0p9o6lg/ZZ3WUJtx7UBBb1qYMZEDNC19Hbb84wt88= (in DER format). If the signature is valid, the script generates a bot identifier (a number from 0 to 1), after which it requests a command from the C2 server in a loop. The response is obfuscated. De-obfuscation is performed as follows:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The application downloads Node.js from the official website.<br/>JavaScript is embedded in the file body.<br/>It does not contain a hardcoded command and control (C2) address; instead the application uses DGA.<br/>All communication with C2 servers is performed through a DNS tunnel.</li>

Unlike the file used in the March 22 campaign, however, this version does not have a built-in script and does not download the Node.js interpreter from the official website. Instead, the application copies both the script and the interpreter from its own current location, i.e., from the network drive 192.248.176[.]138.<br/>The final-stage script is much simpler than the above version. It lacks both DGA (the IP address 46.101.113[.]161 is specified as C2) and data encryption. In fact, all communication between the Trojan and C2 could be viewed using an ordinary traffic sniffer.<br/>Group-IB experts retrieved several JS commands that were executed on the infected device. They were all designed to obtain information about an infected device. They even included CMD commands (as described in the corresponding section).</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The above described algorithm is used to de-obfuscate all traffic between the malware and the C2 server, with only the key changing (going forward we will therefore only say that the data is de-obfuscated using a given key). After de-obfuscation, a JS script is immediately executed by the interpreter. The textual description is complicated, so let's illustrate it using a sample analyzed by the THF Polygon.

We will not dwell on this any further as we believe that all interaction with the server occurs in this way.<br/>The script verifies the digital signature of the received data using the function crypto.verify with the base64-encoded key MCowBQYDK2VwAyEAgp0p9o6lg/ZZ3WUJtx7UBBb1qYMZEDNC19Hbb84wt88= (in DER format). If the signature is valid, the script generates a bot identifier (a number from 0 to 1), after which it requests a command from the C2 server in a loop. The response is obfuscated.

                                        <li>The archive contained the group's new tool, which judging by the PDB string the developer named TinyFluff. TinyFluff is a successor to the gang's custom backdoor called TinyNode, which OldGremlin used as the primary downloader for receiving and running malicious scripts. The purpose of TinyFluff was to launch the interpreter Node.js on the infected device and grant remote access to it (a detailed description of the interpreter can be found in the "Tools" section).<br/><br/>The key features of this version of TinyFluff are:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Let's begin with the tf.exe file (SHA1: c82e12e563d5d5f4a8dd67703b5df7373b457abc) as the tool is much simpler than its predecessor. Once launched, the application creates the directory %APPDATA%\%MachineGuid%, where %MachineGuid% is the registry value for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\MachineGuid. If the directory already exists, the application terminates itself. The application copies the interpreter Node.js (node.exe) and the malicious script s.txt to the created directory. The script is heavily obfuscated, but if it can be run then there is no need to waste time on de-obfuscation because the obfuscated layer restarts Node.js and passes a "clean" script to it as an argument.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>has nothing to do with documents used in the campaign.<br/><br/>The payload, as you may have guessed, is TinyFluff. Unlike the file used in the March 22 campaign, however, this version does not have a built-in script and does not download the Node.js interpreter from the official website. Instead, the application copies both the script and the interpreter from its own current location, i.e., from the network drive 192.248.176[.]138.<br/>The final-stage script is much simpler than the above version. It lacks both DGA (the IP address 46.101.113[.]161 is specified as C2) and data encryption. In fact, all communication between the Trojan and C2 could be viewed using an ordinary traffic sniffer.<br/>Group-IB experts retrieved several JS commands that were executed on the infected device. They were all designed to obtain information about an infected device. They even included CMD commands (as described in the corresponding section).</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The application downloads Node.js from the official website.<br/>JavaScript is embedded in the file body.<br/>It does not contain a hardcoded command and control (C2) address; instead the application uses DGA.<br/>All communication with C2 servers is performed through a DNS tunnel.</li>

Its functionality is simple: it connects to the address 46.101.113[.]161:80, passes the format identifier /{0.[0-9]*/}, receives the command in a loop, and executes it (using the function eval). The commands are described in detail in the relevant section.<br/>Although the second version of TinyFluff (SHA1: bd0a6a3628f268a37ac9d708d03f57feef5ed55e) was discovered earlier (and the compilation date is more recent), it is more sophisticated. Just like the previous version, it places the script and the interpreter in the directory %APPDATA%\%MachineGuid%. However, the interpreter is downloaded from the official website: http://nodejs.org/dist/latest-erbium/win-x86/node.exe, and the malicious script is located in a resource of the executable file named TXT. As in the above case, the de-obfuscated script can be obtained from an argument of the node.exe child process:</li>

Once launched, the application creates the directory %APPDATA%\%MachineGuid%, where %MachineGuid% is the registry value for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\MachineGuid. If the directory already exists, the application terminates itself. The application copies the interpreter Node.js (node.exe) and the malicious script s.txt to the created directory. The script is heavily obfuscated, but if it can be run then there is no need to waste time on de-obfuscation because the obfuscated layer restarts Node.js and passes a "clean" script to it as an argument.</li>

The tool carries out all communication through a DNS tunnel, which means that all the data transmitted by the Trojan is in a subdomain and the server's response is in a TXT record. We will not dwell on this any further as we believe that all interaction with the server occurs in this way.<br/>The script verifies the digital signature of the received data using the function crypto.verify with the base64-encoded key MCowBQYDK2VwAyEAgp0p9o6lg/ZZ3WUJtx7UBBb1qYMZEDNC19Hbb84wt88= (in DER format). If the signature is valid, the script generates a bot identifier (a number from 0 to 1), after which it requests a command from the C2 server in a loop. The response is obfuscated.

Once launched, the application creates the directory %APPDATA%\%MachineGuid%, where %MachineGuid% is the registry value for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\MachineGuid. If the directory already exists, the application terminates itself. The application copies the interpreter Node.js (node.exe) and the malicious script s.txt to the created directory. The script is heavily obfuscated, but if it can be run then there is no need to waste time on de-obfuscation because the obfuscated layer restarts Node.js and passes a "clean" script to it as an argument.</li>

Group-IB discovered two LNK files that were associated with the IP address 46.101.113[.]161 (used to resolve NS records for subdomains from the previous malicious email campaign). Both files were located in archives available for downloading from Dropbox:</li>

Unlike the file used in the March 22 campaign, however, this version does not have a built-in script and does not download the Node.js interpreter from the official website. Instead, the application copies both the script and the interpreter from its own current location, i.e., from the network drive 192.248.176[.]138.<br/>The final-stage script is much simpler than the above version. It lacks both DGA (the IP address 46.101.113[.]161 is specified as C2) and data encryption. In fact, all communication between the Trojan and C2 could be viewed using an ordinary traffic sniffer.<br/>Group-IB experts retrieved several JS commands that were executed on the infected device.

Once launched, the application creates the directory %APPDATA%\%MachineGuid%, where %MachineGuid% is the registry value for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\MachineGuid. If the directory already exists, the application terminates itself. The application copies the interpreter Node.js (node.exe) and the malicious script s.txt to the created directory. The script is heavily obfuscated, but if it can be run then there is no need to waste time on de-obfuscation because the obfuscated layer restarts Node.js and passes a "clean" script to it as an argument.</li>

                                        <li>As mentioned above, Group-IB experts detected two versions of TinyFluff:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>has nothing to do with documents used in the campaign.<br/><br/>The payload, as you may have guessed, is TinyFluff. Unlike the file used in the March 22 campaign, however, this version does not have a built-in script and does not download the Node.js interpreter from the official website. Instead, the application copies both the script and the interpreter from its own current location, i.e., from the network drive 192.248.176[.]138.<br/>The final-stage script is much simpler than the above version. It lacks both DGA (the IP address 46.101.113[.]161 is specified as C2) and data encryption. In fact, all communication between the Trojan and C2 could be viewed using an ordinary traffic sniffer.<br/>Group-IB experts retrieved several JS commands that were executed on the infected device. They were all designed to obtain information about an infected device. They even included CMD commands (as described in the corresponding section).</li>
                                    
                                        <li>As seen in the screenshot, the argument of the second node.exe process is a script without obfuscation. Its functionality is simple: it connects to the address 46.101.113[.]161:80, passes the format identifier /{0.[0-9]*/}, receives the command in a loop, and executes it (using the function eval). The commands are described in detail in the relevant section.<br/>Although the second version of TinyFluff (SHA1: bd0a6a3628f268a37ac9d708d03f57feef5ed55e) was discovered earlier (and the compilation date is more recent), it is more sophisticated. Just like the previous version, it places the script and the interpreter in the directory %APPDATA%\%MachineGuid%. However, the interpreter is downloaded from the official website: http://nodejs.org/dist/latest-erbium/win-x86/node.exe, and the malicious script is located in a resource of the executable file named TXT. As in the above case, the de-obfuscated script can be obtained from an argument of the node.exe child process:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The archive contained the group's new tool, which judging by the PDB string the developer named TinyFluff.

                                        <li>The above described algorithm is used to de-obfuscate all traffic between the malware and the C2 server, with only the key changing (going forward we will therefore only say that the data is de-obfuscated using a given key). After de-obfuscation, a JS script is immediately executed by the interpreter. The textual description is complicated, so let's illustrate it using a sample analyzed by the THF Polygon. Registration looked as follows:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>For each domain, the script generates a subdomain in the format [0-9a-f]{4}.[0-9a-f]{8}.%dga_domain%, creates a DNS query, and receives a TXT record. The tool carries out all communication through a DNS tunnel, which means that all the data transmitted by the Trojan is in a subdomain and the server's response is in a TXT record. We will not dwell on this any further as we believe that all interaction with the server occurs in this way.<br/>The script verifies the digital signature of the received data using the function crypto.verify with the base64-encoded key MCowBQYDK2VwAyEAgp0p9o6lg/ZZ3WUJtx7UBBb1qYMZEDNC19Hbb84wt88= (in DER format). If the signature is valid, the script generates a bot identifier (a number from 0 to 1), after which it requests a command from the C2 server in a loop. The response is obfuscated. De-obfuscation is performed as follows:</li>

The tool carries out all communication through a DNS tunnel, which means that all the data transmitted by the Trojan is in a subdomain and the server's response is in a TXT record. We will not dwell on this any further as we believe that all interaction with the server occurs in this way.<br/>The script verifies the digital signature of the received data using the function crypto.verify with the base64-encoded key MCowBQYDK2VwAyEAgp0p9o6lg/ZZ3WUJtx7UBBb1qYMZEDNC19Hbb84wt88= (in DER format). If the signature is valid, the script generates a bot identifier (a number from 0 to 1), after which it requests a command from the C2 server in a loop. The response is obfuscated. De-obfuscation is performed as follows:</li>
