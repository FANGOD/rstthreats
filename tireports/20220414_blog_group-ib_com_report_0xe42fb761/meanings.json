They remain one of the very few Russian-speaking ransomware gangs operating in Russia. As in their past attacks, the gremlins used carefully crafted fake emails, an up-to-date news agenda, and new custom tools. The latter included TinyFluff, which we analyzed in detail. We have reason to believe that the new campaigns may have infected a large number of companies and that in the coming months the attackers will slowly and carefully move through their infrastructure, bypassing existing security systems.<crlf>To prevent ransomware attacks, Group-IB recommends that companies use",

All cards issued in our country will no longer work.<crlf>Everyone must therefore urgently issue [masked] cards and link them to their bank payroll.<crlf>Use the following instructions [hyperlink] for the following banks: [masked]<crlf>Fill out the form (see attachment) and send it back, making sure to specify the bank branch at which it is convenient for you to pick up the bank card.<crlf>Remember that if you want to link a card to a payroll, you must inform the accounting department of the account details after receiving the card.<crlf>Please sign and send the form to our email address within 5 (five) hours from the moment you receive this email. For the purposes of efficiency, please send it in this email thread chain.<crlf>[masked],<crlf>Senior Accountant at [masked]<crlf><crlf>To have a new payment card \"issued\", the client was supposed to read the guidelines and fill out a questionnaire.

One more campaign was discovered later in the year.<crlf><crlf>After the first attacks, it became clear that OldGremlin prepares their phishing emails with great care and monitors the news agenda closely. Their choices for email subjects included remote work during the pandemic, protests in Belarus, and an interview request from a known financial journalist working for a Russian media outlet, called RBC.<crlf>Another OldGremlin hallmark is that the group conducts multi-stage targeted attacks using sophisticated tactics and techniques. For example, they did not send their TinyCryptor ransomware directly by email; instead they first obtained remote access to the victim's machine. The latter was used as a springboard to conduct reconnaissance, collect data, and then move laterally across the organization's network.<crlf>OldGremlin launched only one mass phishing email campaign in 2021 (in February), but it was so successful that, apparently, it fueled the gang for the entire year. A few months later, Group-IB team discovered that the February email campaign was the initial entry point and source of a number of attacks. Moreover, last year OldGremlin became the greediest cybergang targeting Russia: they demanded as much as $3 million from one of their victims.<crlf><crlf>In late March 2022, OldGremlin put themselves on the radar with two malicious email campaigns. As in past attacks, the group bombarded Russian companies with another batch of emails exploiting trending news topics. This time they played the sanctions card, masquerading as representatives of a Russian financial organization.<crlf>Given the fact that many international providers of email security products suspended operations on the Russian market, the campaigns of OldGremlin and other threat actors that use email at the initial stage are likely to become more successful and frequent.<crlf>Having identified one potential victim (a mining company), Group-IB Computer Emergency Response team (CERT-GIB) warned the company in question about the threat.<crlf>In this blog post, Group-IB experts share technical descriptions of OldGremlin's new attacks and tools and map the group's main tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.",
