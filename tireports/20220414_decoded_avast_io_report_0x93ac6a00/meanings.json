                        "Microsoft recently announced a joint investigation of multiple security companies and information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs) with the aim to take down the Zloader botnet and took the whole case to court.",
                        "We have to briefly cover the BinStorage the data format used by Zloader to communicate with C&Cs and to store various data: web injects, system information, stolen data and logs. BinStorages consists of the header and records (also called fields). Main header stores information about the number of records, data size (in bytes) and their MD5. Records have their own small headers, containing FieldID - DWORD describing the meaning of the data.",
                        "Zloader is able to download and execute arbitrary files by the commands from his C&Cs, but for a long time we havent seen these commands at all. Things changed on 24 November 2021, when botnet 9092ca received a command to download and execute the file from teamworks455[.]com. This domain was mentioned in [6].",
                        "Zloader 2 (also known as Silent Night) is a multifunctional modular banking malware, aimed at providing unauthorized access to online banking systems, payment systems and other financial-related services. In addition to these functions its able to download and execute arbitrary files, steal files, inject arbitrary code to visited HTML pages and so on.",
                        "Third example qyfurihpsbhbuvitilgw[.]com which was found in Zeus configuration update, received from C&C on 20 October 2021. It must be added to a C&C list and then used by Zloader bots. The same domain was found in Ursnif webinjects on 1 November 2021",
                        "And, finally, 4th example etjmejjcxjtwweitluuw[.]com This domain was generated using DGA from key 03d5ae30a0bd934a23b6a7f0756aa504 and date 22 September 2021. We have very strong evidence that it was active on that date as a Zloader C&C. The same host was found in Ursnif WebInjects on 1 November 2021",
                        "It is not the only digital signature, shared among Ursnif and Zloader samples.",
                        "It was quite a big surprise when we found Zloader samples and Ursnif samples signed with the same digital signature!",
                        "We are proud we could be part of the investigation as we continue our mission to make the world a safer place for everybody. We hope for a successful takedown of the Zloader botnet and prosecution of people who created and operated it.",

                        "To achieve his goals, Zloader performs WinAPI hooking. In order to perform it, Backdoor module enumerates processes and injects itself into the following ones:",
                        "Root path is %APPDATA%. Zloader creates directories with random names inside it to store modules, stolen data and logs. These paths are stored into the MAIN_STRUCT.",
                        "According to ZeusMuseum, first versions of Zeus were observed in 2006-2008. Later, in 2011 its source code leaked. As a result, new versions and variants appeared. One of the Zeus successors named Zloader appeared at the turn of 2016 and 2017. Finally, another successor named Silent Night appeared in 2019. It was for sale on the underground market.",
                        "Another example aerulonoured[.]su host used by Zloader to receive stolen data at least from August 2021. It also appeared in Ursnif webinjects in November 2021.",

                        "The most important and interesting data structure, stored by the Zloader in the registry is called MAIN_STRUCT. Its subkey in the ROOT_KEY and the value name is derived from the RC4 key found in the configuration. We suppose that bots from one actor use the same RC4 key, so they can easily find and read the MAIN_STRUCT.",
                        "Although the original name of the malware likely was Silent Night and the ZeusMuseum calls it Zloader 2 we are simply going to use the name Zloader.",
                        "Zloader modules (at least Downloaders and Backdoors) use a registry to store various data necessary for their work. The ROOT_KEY for this data is",
                        "Moreover, Raccoon was mentioned in [6] before we received commands from C&Cs with links to Raccoon. We are lost in conjecture why Zloader operators used Raccoon Stealer? You can read our dive into Racoon stealer here.",
                        "Zloader code is very recognizable. First of all, it is diluted with functions which will never be called. Downloader module may contain functions from the Backdoor module and vice versa. In total, about a half of the code will never be called.",
                        "Injected code is usually small: from dozens of bytes up to 20 kb. To perform its tasks, it loads JavaScript code from external domains, controlled by bad guys. Analysis of these domains allowed us to find connections between Zloader operators and other cybercrime gangs.",
                        "As was shown before, built in configuration has a list of hardcoded C&Cs. Actually, these lists have not changed for years. To bypass blocking of these hardcoded C&Cs, Zloader uses DGA Domain Generation Algorithm. In the Zloader, DGA produces 32 domains, based on the current date and RC4 key from the configuration.",
                        "Zloader was distributed using classic email spam. In 2021 the attackers abused Google AdWords to advertise sites with fake Zoom communication tool which actually installed Zloader. Another campaign in 2021 used fake pornsites, where users needed to download additional software to watch video. Downloaders are distributed in a packed form sometimes signed with a valid digital signature."
