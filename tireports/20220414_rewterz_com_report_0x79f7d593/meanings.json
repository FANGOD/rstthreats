Its been utilized against large companies and government institutions across the world, especially in North America. Conti steals important files and information from targeted networks and threatens to disseminate it unless the ransom is paid. Conti ransomware enhances performance by utilizing up to 32 simultaneous encryption operations, and is very likely directly controlled by its controllers.

This feature has the noticeable impact of being able to create targeted harm in an environment in a way that might hinder incident response actions."
