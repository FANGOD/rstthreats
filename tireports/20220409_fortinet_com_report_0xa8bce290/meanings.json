                        "The Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) allows security products to integrate better with Windows to be able to scan all kinds of different objects, such as PowerShell scripts, JavaScript, VBScript, etc. By bypassing AMSI, the malware can take away significant capabilities from the security products running on the machine. Pandora bypasses AMSI by patching the AmsiScanBuffer() function in the amsi.dll in memory.",
                        "The Pandora ransomware contains all of the most important features that state-of-the-art ransomware samples usually contain. The level of obfuscation to slow down analysis is more advanced than average malware. The threat actor also paid attention to unlock files to guarantee the maximum encryption coverage, while still allowing the machine to run. We can already see anti-security product features. We can expect the threat actor to develop these capabilities further. There is currently no proof that Pandora operates as Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), but the time investment in the complexity of the malware might indicate that they are moving in that direction in the long term. The current attacks and leaks might be a way to make their name in the ransomware field, which they could capitalize on if they adopt the RaaS model later. It is worth tracking the threat actor to monitor how their malware changes.",
                        "The Pandora ransomware group emerged into the already crowded ransomware field as early as in mid-February 2022 and targets corporate networks for financial gain. The group got recent publicity after they announced that they acquired data from an international supplier in the automotive industry. The incident came as surprise as the attack came two weeks after another automotive supplier was reportedly hit with unknown ransomware, which resulted in one of the worlds biggest car manufacturers suspending factory operations. The threat group uses the double extortion method to increase pressure on the victim. This means that they not only encrypt the victims files, but also exfiltrate them and threaten to release the data if the victim does not pay.",
                        "Similar to the AMSI bypass, Pandora disables the Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) feature, by patching the EtwEventWrite() function in the Windows kernel (ntdll.dll). Figure 16 shows that the first byte of the function is replaced with 0xC3, which is the ret instruction. This renders the EtwEventWrite() function useless, because after every call it return immediately without logging the event.",
                        "Like a lot of other ransomware, Pandora deletes the Windows Shadow Copies, which could help the operator restore the machine to a state before the infection. Figure 15 shows the call to ShellExecuteW() with the parameters from runtime(T1059). We can see that it uses the vssadmin.exe.",
                        "The Pandora ransomware has the capabilities to disable some of the security measures on the target machine.",
                        "The Pandora Group has a leak site in the Dark Web (TOR network), where they publicly announce their victims and threaten them with the data leak. There are currently three victims listed on the leak site (see Figure 1), a U.S.-based real estate agency, a Japanese technology company, and a U.S. law firm.",
                        "One of the most significant aspect of the Pandora ransomware is the extensive use of anti-reverse-engineering techniques. This is not new for malware, but Pandora lies on the extreme side of how much is invested in slowing analysis down. In this section we will go through the different techniques that were identified.",
                        "The analyzed Pandora ransomware sample is detected by the following (AV) signature:",
                        "Figure 4 shows the graph view of the main function in the unpacked code. We can see that it does not resemble a normal functions control flow. It looks like a huge switch-case statement, which is the result of the control-flow flattening that implements a state machine. However, in Pandoras case most of the basic blocks are not connected at all. This is the result of the opaque predicates. Most of the jumps between basic blocks are calculated at runtime, as shown in Figure 5.",
                        "Control-Flow Flattening is an obfuscation technique that can hide the structure of the program by modifying the control-flow. In the simplest case, it replaces the normal control flow of each function with a state machine, thus it makes harder for an analyst to quickly understand how each function works. Pandora uses a more complex control-flow flattening combined with opaque predicates, to complicate the control flow even further.",
                        "Once a file is encrypted in memory, it is written to disk. After that the file is renamed to have the .pandora extension.",
                        "The Restart Manager is a Windows feature to reduce the number of restarts needed during installation and updates. The reason for a restart is usually because a file that needs to be updated is locked by a running process. The Restart Manager can save the state and stop the locking process to unlock the target file. Once the update is finished, it can restore the locking process again. Pandora uses the Restart Manager to make sure that even files that are currently locked will be encrypted. For each file the following process is executed:",
                        "In Greek mythology, opening of the infamous Pandoras box (jar) introduced terrible things to the world. That can also be said about todays ransomware. The newly emerged Pandora ransomware that crowned the name is no exception. It steals data from the victims network, encrypts the victims files, and unleashes the stolen data if the victim opts not to pay. The Greek myth says hope was left in the box. Does that hold true for Pandora ransomware, an emerging malware that shows all techniques used by modern ransomware? In this blog we are taking a hammer and crowbar to look inside todays Pandoras box to find out what mysteries it holds. We will discuss:",
                        "Pandora uses multiple threads to speed up the encryption process. For that it uses Windowss IO Completion Ports concept. This allows threads to wait for a file/network handle to appear in the IO Completion Port queue and process them. Pandora uses unassociated IO Completion Ports and sends any data through it using the OVERLAPPED structure. In this case drives and file paths will be passed to threads to process (enumerate or encrypt) them. The IO Completion Port is set up using the CreateIOCompletionPort() API function as shown in Figure 10. By passing INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE as the first parameter (rcx = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) and NULL as the second (rdx = 0x0) an unassociated IO Completion Port is created. The fourth parameter is the NumberOfConcurrentThreads, which is set to 4 (r9 = 0x4), defines that maximum 4 threads are allowed to work with this IO Completion Port.",
                        "Before a file is encrypted, Pandora does the following checks to make sure that it does not render the machine inoperable. Each target file is checked against the following blacklist of file and folder names. If the target file is on the list, Pandora will not encrypt it.",

                        "The Pandora ransomware group emerged into the already crowded ransomware field as early as in mid-February 2022 and targets corporate networks for financial gain. The group got recent publicity after they announced that they acquired data from an international supplier in the automotive industry. The incident came as surprise as the attack came two weeks after another automotive supplier was reportedly hit with unknown ransomware, which resulted in one of the worlds biggest car manufacturers suspending factory operations. The threat group uses the double extortion method to increase pressure on the victim. This means that they not only encrypt the victims files, but also exfiltrate them and threaten to release the data if the victim does not pay.",

It is the ransomware itself, so by the time this file is executed during an attack, the attackers probably already had extensive access to the victims network, and they had already exfiltrated the data they will use for the extortion.

The group got recent publicity after they announced that they acquired data from an international supplier in the automotive industry. The incident came as surprise as the attack came two weeks after another automotive supplier was reportedly hit with unknown ransomware, which resulted in one of the worlds biggest car manufacturers suspending factory operations. The threat group uses the double extortion method to increase pressure on the victim. This means that they not only encrypt the victims files, but also exfiltrate them and threaten to release the data if the victim does not pay."
