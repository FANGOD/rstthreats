Per Okta, the data that was accessible in this breach was very limited though its worth noting that Lapsus$ refuted this statement, claiming the ability to reset passwords and MFA factors.<crlf>Per Okta, the incident was mitigated within hours of the initial compromise and is no longer a security risk.<crlf>On March 22, 2022, Lapsus$ posted screenshots of their compromise to Telegram.",

The group specializes in stealing and extorting data in exchange for a ransom payment. Lapsus$ is known to leverage low-tech but high-impact methods to gain access to organizations. Lapsus$ has used tactics such as social engineering, SIM swapping, and paying employees and business partners for access to credentials and multifactor authentication approvals.
