                        "An emergent and effective data-harvesting tool dubbed Oski is proliferating in North America and China, stealing online account credentials, credit card numbers, crypto wallet accounts, and more. The malware is still in its developing phase but packs a punch with its capabilities. Oski C2s dashboard revealed that Oskis theft tactics involve extracting credentials using man-in-the-browser (MitB) attacks by hooking the browser processes using DLL injection, It also extracts credentials from the registry, passwords from the browser SQLite database, and stored session cookies of all stripes, including crypto-wallet cookies from Bitcoin Core, Ethereum, Monero, Litecoin, and others."
