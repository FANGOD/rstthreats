These documents are directed at the hacking operators/associates of the group. We havent seen documentation or manuals regarding initial access practices, only design documents for various internet crawlers. We think this might indicate that this vector is somewhat automated. The operator guidelines are used after the initial breach has been made.",
                        "Contis toolkit",
                        "First and foremost, Contis goal is to reach the domain controller (DC). Operators are instructed to work their way to the DC via the aforementioned process of stealing credentials and expanding. Since the process seems to be largely manual, this allows Conti operators a level of discretion in choosing targets. Once the domain admin credentials are found, Conti operators will have gained access to a number of critical assets:",
                        "Besides the existing local privilege escalation (LPE) tools available in Cobalt Strike, it appears that Conti uses the LPE variant of PrintNightmare to create new local administrators for beacons that run as a regular user.",
                        "Like many modern cybercrime groups, Conti operates like a business. As outlined in this article from Wired, the group is capable of making profits (some operators have claimed personal gains of almost US$100 thousand), growing their operation, and adding new operators and even has a CEO. As part of their business operation, Conti employs an onboarding process for new operators, governed by manuals detailing their methodology and modus operandi. In these manuals, we find important information on how Conti propagates inside networks, what targets they select, and what tools they use.",
                        "Summary: Contis toolkit",
                        "Most of Contis credential harvesting manuals reference Mimikatz, but their full arsenal includes:",
                        "Conti has various ways to avoid detection. The primary (and most surprising) one is ensuring that their released tools do not trigger detection in the first place.",
                        "In addition, Conti has some manuals on shutting down Windows Defender, either by manipulating the hosts policy to turn it off, or by killing its service. It seems that special attention is given to the service, likely due to its widespread usage in target organizations.",
                        "Conti's leak website, front page",
                        "Contis attack methodology",

                        "Although some readers may expect to see 0days and proprietary tools, the leak demonstrates that a tool or techniques effectiveness is not directly correlated with how novel or unknown it is. Readers would be advised to pay close attention to the tools and techniques leaked from the Conti documentation in an effort to have more effective mitigation of these TTPs in their own defense.",
                        "Keeping track of what software is installed and where it is installed can help detect unwanted additions. This holds true for Contis Atera and AnyDesk backdoors, and also for other attacks. (Looking at you, LAPSUS$, with your procexp and ProcessHacker.) In addition, patch management can also keep your chestnuts out of the fire. None of the exploits discussed in this blog are recent; patches were released long ago. Despite this, Conti and other groups have been able to be successful because many servers remain unpatched.",
                        "Conti relies a lot on existing users and their credentials for lateral movement and access. Enforcing control over who can access what and where, and purposely separating power users from daily activities, can greatly inhibit and slow the lateral movement process. It also allows for much more detection surface.",
                        "Conti is a notorious ransomware group that targets high-revenue organizations. They were first detected in 2020, and appear to be based in Russia. It is believed that the group is the successor to Ryuk ransomware group. According to Chainalysis, the ransomware group was the highest grossing of all ransomware groups in 2021, with an estimated revenue of at least 180 million dollars.",
                        "Contis step-by-step guide to network dominance",
                        "Contis attack doctrine is not a novel one. The use of effective tools and persistence seems to do the trick. The process appears to be mostly hands on keyboard while some functions can be scripted or automated, operators are generally expected to do the work of stealing credentials and making cognizant decisions on spreading in the network.",
                        "Contis documentation includes evidence that they test their tools and techniques against a number of well-known antiviruses. These include testing that their droppers and injectors dont trigger various antivirus engines. To do this, they use both local machines running the antivirus engines and dyncheck, a platform that allows sample upload and analysis (similar to VirusTotal, though it seems to not be accessible at the moment).",
                        "Before Conti can begin wreaking havoc inside the network, they have to first breach it and get a foothold. As mentioned before, there is nothing in the documentation that outlines this process; rather, it seems Conti has developed various crawlers and scanners that scour the internet in search for exploitable/breachable servers. These crawlers will either grant them that initial access to a victim network, or mark them as breachable for their operators and affiliates.",
                        "Although there is still much that is unknown about Conti and other ransomware groups, these documents have given the security community a firsthand look at a cybercriminal organization. This information is invaluable as we continue the fight against them and against ransomware in general.",
                        "As shown in the screenshots below, taken from Contis site, Conti operates on a release timeline of sorts: Once theyve alerted the organization of the extortion, they release more and more of the data theyve exfiltrated, the longer the victim takes to pay them. The group does not appear to have a predefined ransom price guideline, with some leaked chat logs showing group members discussing the ransom price for victims.",
                        "Conti illustrates their doctrine with a step-by-step technical guideline on gaining network dominance. The following is an almost literal translation of their method, but a bit more organized than the original text. It requires some technical understanding of the tools and processes used. However, for those concerned with defending their organization against similar attacks, or those looking to emulate a Conti attack, valuable information can be gleaned as to the type of telemetry that should appear during the lateral movement and privilege escalation phases.",
                        "None of the tools Conti is using are particularly novel. Contis operators have many tools and methods that they employ to infect and eventually encrypt target networks, but they are all known to us. Theyre not unique zero-day threats, theyre common knowledge TTPs that are also employed by red teams everywhere.",
                        "To achieve their network infiltration and propagation goals, Conti employs various tools, most of them not of Contis own making. In fact, only the crypter, the trojan, and the injector seem to be proprietary, but for lateral movement, propagation, and exfiltration Conti seems to use a plethora of tools that should be familiar to anyone on both red and blue teams: Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz, and PSExec, to name a few.",
                        "It has become a bit of a trope to say we need to understand the attackers point of view, but there is a lot of truth to it. By looking at Conti as a business operation whose go-to-market strategy was leaked, we can act as their competitors in a sense, using their own intellectual property against them.",
                        "It is likely that not every operator follows this to the letter, but it should shed some light on the thought process of the Conti gang. If you are more interested in how to mitigate the threat, rather than the threat itself, you can jump to our Mitigations section.",
                        "Before any attack can propagate inside your network, the attacker needs to get a foothold in it. In Contis cases, their initial access crawlers and vectors include phishing (mail spambot) and exploiting internet-facing services (OWA, SQL injection, Apache Tomcat cgi-bin). In most cases, a good web application firewall should block most attacker attempts to gain that initial foothold in the network.",
                        "This is the last line of defense on the machines in the network. A good (and up-to-date) endpoint detection and response (EDR) or antivirus (AV) solution may help detect and block the tools used during the attack. It is a cat-and-mouse game, (as weve seen that Conti tests whether their tools bypass detection), but its better to have a cat that sometimes catches mice than no cat and a mouse infestation.",
                        "Akamai Security Researchers have reviewed and analyzed the leaked Conti groups internal documentation to understand the tools and techniques used by a modern ransomware group.<crlf>Conti is a ransomware gang with revenues projected at almost 200 million dollars and is considered one of the most successful ransomware gangs in the world.<crlf>The analysis reveals a list of concrete techniques and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IoC) employed by the group, as well as potential mitigation techniques that can be utilized by blue teams.<crlf>These attack scenarios are multifaceted and detail-oriented. They have found a formula that continues to work: harvest credentials, propagate, repeat.<crlf>The attack documentation shows a strong focus on hands on keyboard network propagation hinting at the need for strong protections against lateral movement, and its critical role in defending against ransomware.<crlf>These TTPs are well-known, but highly effective techniques. It is a sobering reminder of the arsenal that is at the disposal of attack groups like Conti, and may hint at the tools often used by other groups. Studying these TTPs offers security teams an inside scoop into the attackers modus operandi in an effort to be better prepared against them.<crlf>The groups emphasis in their documentation on hacking and hands-on propagation, rather than encryption, should drive network defenders to focus on those parts of the kill chain as well, instead of focusing on the encryption phase.",
                        "For a correlation between attack method and its mitigation, please refer to Summary: Contis toolkit.",
                        "Interestingly, Conti is known for being a double-extortion attack group Conti both exfiltrates and encrypts data in order to ensure payment. The exfiltrated data is either used to blackmail a company into paying the ransom or sold to the highest bidder. In this way, even if backups are available, companies are pressured to pay in order to avoid the damage that may be caused by a leak. This method was first popularized by the Maze ransomware group, which was supposedly shut down in 2020, and from which many members were recruited into Conti.",
                        "In this blog post, we discuss the attack methodology and tools used by the Conti ransomware group, as gleaned from their leaked documentation. If youd just like to know how to defend yourself and your network, or just want a quick list of their TTPs, you can skip to our Mitigations or summary sections."

In addition, patch management can also keep your chestnuts out of the fire. None of the exploits discussed in this blog are recent; patches were released long ago. Despite this, Conti and other groups have been able to be successful because many servers remain unpatched.",

The exfiltrated data is either used to blackmail a company into paying the ransom or sold to the highest bidder. In this way, even if backups are available, companies are pressured to pay in order to avoid the damage that may be caused by a leak. This method was first popularized by the Maze ransomware group, which was supposedly shut down in 2020, and from which many members were recruited into Conti.",

The exfiltrated data is either used to blackmail a company into paying the ransom or sold to the highest bidder. In this way, even if backups are available, companies are pressured to pay in order to avoid the damage that may be caused by a leak. This method was first popularized by the Maze ransomware group, which was supposedly shut down in 2020, and from which many members were recruited into Conti."

Then, the operator is instructed to use credentials on the next machine, expanding their reach, then repeat step one.

The following is an almost literal translation of their method, but a bit more organized than the original text. It requires some technical understanding of the tools and processes used. However, for those concerned with defending their organization against similar attacks, or those looking to emulate a Conti attack, valuable information can be gleaned as to the type of telemetry that should appear during the lateral movement and privilege escalation phases.",
                        "Both documents describe the same methodology, which can be summarized as harvest credentials, propagate, repeat. As mentioned, an operator is assumed to have access to a machine in the network. Their goal then is to begin propagating through the network, first either by attempting to dump and decrypt passwords or by brute force. Then, the operator is instructed to use credentials on the next machine, expanding their reach, then repeat step one. Likewise, operators are taught that encryption doesnt start until network dominance has been reached, which ensures the impact is maximized.",
