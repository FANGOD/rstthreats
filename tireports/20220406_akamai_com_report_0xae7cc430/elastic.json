            "text": "Akamai Security Researchers have reviewed and analyzed the leaked Conti groups internal documentation to understand the tools and techniques used by a modern ransomware group.\nConti is a ransomware gang with revenues projected at almost 200 million dollars and is considered one of the most successful ransomware gangs in the world.\nThe analysis reveals a list of concrete techniques and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IoC) employed by the group, as well as potential mitigation techniques that can be utilized by blue teams.\nThese attack scenarios are multifaceted and detail-oriented. They have found a formula that continues to work: harvest credentials, propagate, repeat.\nThe attack documentation shows a strong focus on hands on keyboard network propagation hinting at the need for strong protections against lateral movement, and its critical role in defending against ransomware.\nThese TTPs are well-known, but highly effective techniques. It is a sobering reminder of the arsenal that is at the disposal of attack groups like Conti, and may hint at the tools often used by other groups. Studying these TTPs offers security teams an inside scoop into the attackers modus operandi in an effort to be better prepared against them.\nThe groups emphasis in their documentation on hacking and hands-on propagation, rather than encryption, should drive network defenders to focus on those parts of the kill chain as well, instead of focusing on the encryption phase."

            "text": "Conti is a notorious ransomware group that targets high-revenue organizations. They were first detected in 2020, and appear to be based in Russia. It is believed that the group is the successor to Ryuk ransomware group. According to Chainalysis, the ransomware group was the highest grossing of all ransomware groups in 2021, with an estimated revenue of at least 180 million dollars.\nOn February 27, 2022, the Twitter handle @contileaks was created and began leaking internal documents and chat logs of the group, as well as the addresses of some of their internal servers and source code. It is widely accepted in the community that it was an internal member who leaked the documents after a dispute over the groups public support of the Russian government during the RussianUkrainian conflict, but the person behind the contileaks Twitter account claims to be an independent Ukrainian researcher.\nAlthough leaks like this have happened in the past (usually due to personal interests of the operators), what makes this one particularly interesting is the sheer amount of information leaked. Regardless of the circumstances, these documents give the community a rare glimpse into how these attack groups operate on a grand scale, what they use, and how they think in general.\nThere has, understandably, been a significant amount of news coverage on these documents, particularly the chat logs, which have opened a window into the human connections inside a cybercrime group. However, not much has been written so far about the tools, techniques, and procedures of the group.\nIn an effort to glean this information, we decided to focus on internal documentation, which includes guidelines for operators on target selection, hacking, and using their tools. We believe that these TTPs and methodologies should also give insight into other ransomware operators, allowing us to put ourselves in the shoes of these attackers, understand their ways of operating, and prepare our defenses accordingly.\nIn this blog post, we discuss the attack methodology and tools used by the Conti ransomware group, as gleaned from their leaked documentation. If youd just like to know how to defend yourself and your network, or just want a quick list of their TTPs, you can skip to our Mitigations or summary sections."

            "text": "Like many modern cybercrime groups, Conti operates like a business. As outlined in this article from Wired, the group is capable of making profits (some operators have claimed personal gains of almost US$100 thousand), growing their operation, and adding new operators and even has a CEO. As part of their business operation, Conti employs an onboarding process for new operators, governed by manuals detailing their methodology and modus operandi. In these manuals, we find important information on how Conti propagates inside networks, what targets they select, and what tools they use.\nInterestingly, Conti is known for being a double-extortion attack group Conti both exfiltrates and encrypts data in order to ensure payment. The exfiltrated data is either used to blackmail a company into paying the ransom or sold to the highest bidder. In this way, even if backups are available, companies are pressured to pay in order to avoid the damage that may be caused by a leak. This method was first popularized by the Maze ransomware group, which was supposedly shut down in 2020, and from which many members were recruited into Conti.\nAs shown in the screenshots below, taken from Contis site, Conti operates on a release timeline of sorts: Once theyve alerted the organization of the extortion, they release more and more of the data theyve exfiltrated, the longer the victim takes to pay them. The group does not appear to have a predefined ransom price guideline, with some leaked chat logs showing group members discussing the ransom price for victims.\nConti's leak website, front page\nThe leak features two documents that overview Contis network attack methodology and their propagation goals. These documents are directed at the hacking operators/associates of the group. We havent seen documentation or manuals regarding initial access practices, only design documents for various internet crawlers. We think this might indicate that this vector is somewhat automated. The operator guidelines are used after the initial breach has been made.\nBoth documents describe the same methodology, which can be summarized as harvest credentials, propagate, repeat. As mentioned, an operator is assumed to have access to a machine in the network. Their goal then is to begin propagating through the network, first either by attempting to dump and decrypt passwords or by brute force. Then, the operator is instructed to use credentials on the next machine, expanding their reach, then repeat step one. Likewise, operators are taught that encryption doesnt start until network dominance has been reached, which ensures the impact is maximized.\nContis attack doctrine is not a novel one. The use of effective tools and persistence seems to do the trick. The process appears to be mostly hands on keyboard while some functions can be scripted or automated, operators are generally expected to do the work of stealing credentials and making cognizant decisions on spreading in the network."

            "text": "First and foremost, Contis goal is to reach the domain controller (DC). Operators are instructed to work their way to the DC via the aforementioned process of stealing credentials and expanding. Since the process seems to be largely manual, this allows Conti operators a level of discretion in choosing targets. Once the domain admin credentials are found, Conti operators will have gained access to a number of critical assets:\nLogin logs for most of the network to analyze user behavior\nDNS records for most of the domain, which can be used to infer usage\nPassword hashes\nFocal points for lateral movement\nThis focus on the DC bolsters the idea that the network propagation phase is crucial to the attack. From the DC, the attackers can extract most (if not all) the credentials they need to access the entire network. Also, as more domain configuration is usually stored there, the attackers usually gain a lot of intel about the network itself and its crown jewels.\nConti defines crown jewels as network file shares and other machines that hold data that can be exfiltrated. This data includes:\nEmails, address lists, contact information\nDatabases\nSource code\nAccounting information\nDesign documents\nPasswords/credentials for other networks\nDigital wallets",
            "table": "0\nInterestingly, Conti discourages leaving backdoors and persistence on the DC, and instead encourages backdooring outward-facing servers since a DC is often much more heavily monitored.

It seems that special attention is given to the service, likely due to its widespread usage in target organizations.\nThe persistent backdoor gets command and control addresses from obfuscated methods, which also helps evade detection:\nemercoin dns\nGoogle cache\nbitcoin transactions\nSaving files to the disk is discouraged, and scripts/lolbins are the preferred way of work.

In Contis cases, their initial access crawlers and vectors include phishing (mail spambot) and exploiting internet-facing services (OWA, SQL injection, Apache Tomcat cgi-bin). In most cases, a good web application firewall should block most attacker attempts to gain that initial foothold in the network."

This holds true for Contis Atera and AnyDesk backdoors, and also for other attacks. (Looking at you, LAPSUS$, with your procexp and ProcessHacker.) In addition, patch management can also keep your chestnuts out of the fire. None of the exploits discussed in this blog are recent; patches were released long ago. Despite this, Conti and other groups have been able to be successful because many servers remain unpatched."

A good (and up-to-date) endpoint detection and response (EDR) or antivirus (AV) solution may help detect and block the tools used during the attack. It is a cat-and-mouse game, (as weve seen that Conti tests whether their tools bypass detection), but its better to have a cat that sometimes catches mice than no cat and a mouse infestation.\nSome EDRs today also claim to be able to detect and prevent ransomware heuristically, when it starts encrypting your host. We will not make claims on the efficiency rate of this feature, but it is something to consider."

            "title": "Conclusion",
            "text": "Although there is still much that is unknown about Conti and other ransomware groups, these documents have given the security community a firsthand look at a cybercriminal organization. This information is invaluable as we continue the fight against them and against ransomware in general.\nIt has become a bit of a trope to say we need to understand the attackers point of view, but there is a lot of truth to it. By looking at Conti as a business operation whose go-to-market strategy was leaked, we can act as their competitors in a sense, using their own intellectual property against them.\nNone of the tools Conti is using are particularly novel. Contis operators have many tools and methods that they employ to infect and eventually encrypt target networks, but they are all known to us. Theyre not unique zero-day threats, theyre common knowledge TTPs that are also employed by red teams everywhere.\nDespite this, they still have wide success. If it aint broke, dont fix it, as they say. This supports the idea that security teams need to take a hard look at how theyre approaching defense. Zero days may make the headlines, but the foundational attacks make the money.\nNetwork domination is the goal. Usually, when discussing ransomware, theres more emphasis on the actual act of encryption. The truth, however, that we wanted to showcase with this post, is that there is a long process that has to occur before any encryption can even begin. This time, our discussion is backed by actual ransomware operator documentation. Considering the ratio between hacking documentation and encryption documentation, it becomes clear that the main issue is with hacking (network breach, lateral movement and propagation, avoiding detection) rather than with just data encryption and exfiltration.\nThis is actually somewhat of a silver lining. This knowledge demonstrates that the detection surface that we as defenders can employ is much wider than it seems we just need to reach out and utilize it. Just because these TTPs are not new does not make them trivial if they were, they wouldn't be used by one of the most successful ransomware groups active today. This documentation and analysis supports that we as a community need to look at ransomware more holistically rather than just at the encryption. By focusing primarily on the encryption aspect of ransomware, we are missing out on a wide detection surface which could be the difference between an incident and a headline."
