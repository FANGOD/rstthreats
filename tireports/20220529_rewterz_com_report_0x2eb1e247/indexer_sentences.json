They also discovered infected web apps with malicious JavaScript masquerading as Google Analytics and Meta Pixel (previously Facebook Pixel) scripts. Anti-debugging measures were also implemented in several skimming scripts. Web skimming refer to the illegal practice of gathering financial information from website users during the checkout process. Crooks insert the skimming script into the e-store page by exploiting vulnerabilities in e-commerce platforms and CMSs. In rare circumstances, attackers can inject malicious scripts by exploiting vulnerabilities in installed third-party plugins and themes."}

WAF Web defacement must be stopped at the web application level. Therefore, set up a Web Application Firewall with rules to block suspicious and malicious requests. Patch Patch and upgrade any platforms and software timely and make it into a standard security policy. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities and zero-days. Secure Coding Along with network and system hardening, code hardening should be implemented within the organization so that their websites and software are secure. Use testing tools to detect any vulnerabilities in the deployed codes. 2FA Enable two-factor authentication. Antivirus Enable antivirus and anti-malware software and update signature definitions in a timely manner. Using a multi-layered protection is necessary to secure vulnerable assets Security Best Practices Do not open emails and attachments from unknown or suspicious sources."}
