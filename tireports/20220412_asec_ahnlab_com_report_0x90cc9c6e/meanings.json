                        "The message handling function registered at this moment deletes and terminates a process registered as certain random string when it receives the message WM_COPYDATA. In summary, SystemBC checks for the SystemBC process that has been running when it is executed for the first time. If there is one, it sends a message to terminate the old SystemBC. The previous SystemBC that received the message deletes the task it is registered to and terminates itself, and SystemBC that was executed later deletes the binary of the previous one.",
                        "When SystemBC is initially run, it first checks if the argument is start. It will not have an argument when it is executed for the first time. In this case, it checks the windows of the currently running processes. If there is a process with Microsoft as the window name and win32app as the class name, it will send the message WM_COPYDATA and goes dormant for a certain amount of time. Afterward, it deletes the file for the process.",
                        "According to AhnLabs ASD infrastructure, most of the recent cases involving SystemBC have the malware installed by SmokeLoader. SmokeLoader operates by being injected into explorer.exe (Windows Explorer that is currently being run) and can install additional modules or malware. The figure below shows the log of the injected Explorer process installing SystemBC.",
                        "SystemBC is known to utilize the mini-tor[5] library to use the Tor network.[6] It first goes through the reset process to access Tor. By randomly selecting one of the IP addresses of the hard-coded Authoritative Directory Server, it gets the Consensus data for the Tor network. Then it will start Tor communications based on the settings data it received.",
                        "Note that the exe malware downloaded currently is also SystemBC; this indicates that the command is for updating the binary.",
                        "SystemBCs distribution using RIG exploit kit and Fallout exploit kit was first discovered in 2019. [1] The initial version found in 2019 focused mainly on Socks5 Proxy features and had a small size. According to ProofPoint which first discovered SystemBC, the developer of the malware had a history of selling it under the name socks5 backconnect system.",
                        "SystemBC executed with the start argument attempts to communicate with the C&C server. It has the URL of the C&C server in the data section in XOR-encrypted form. The malware decrypts the C&C server address and port number before communicating with the C&C server. If it cannot access the first URL, it will attempt to communicate with the second one. Since the current analysis target does not have its settings data encrypted, one can check it in its plain form. If the xordata string exists below the settings data, the XOR encoding will not be processed. The 0x32 byte-sized data that has the string is the value for the RC4 key. If a normal RC4 key value exists, the XOR encoding will be processed.",
                        "SystemBC first registered a window class and created a window. The name of the window and class is Microsoft and win32app respectively. As shown in the figure below, the following windows and classes can be seen when SystemBC is executed.",
                        "SystemBC has a number of variants. The exact order is not confirmed, but the variants are categorized based on their additional features. Unlike Type 1 which is an early version and can only update itself, Type 2 can run scripts such as Batch, VBS, and PowerShell after downloading them. It can also download malware in DLL and Shellcode forms to execute them in the memory. In addition, the malware can communicate with the C&C server through the Tor network. [4] Type 3, the second variant, lacks certain features including being able to use the Tor network and execute DLL and Shellcode after downloading them.",
                        "Besides downloader, the main features of SystemBC include being able to operate as Proxy Bot. The figure below shows the commands related to proxies that were mentioned above. Each line creates a socket for the proxy and processes certain proxy packets.",
                        "Figure 1. SystemBC installed by SmokeLoader",
                        "SystemBC uses Raw TCP socket again for HTTP communications. The following is a User-Agent string used for downloading binaries from the URL that was sent.",
                        "If the downloaded payload is DLL, it assigns memory and loads it to run as a new thread. If the # string is behind the URL sent from the C&C server, it calls the export function from the downloaded DLL. For Shellcode, the malware also runs it as a new thread going through the decoding routine. As a result, DLL and Shellcode are not created as files but run in the memory of SystemBC.",
                        "Figure 5. Settings data of SystemBC",
                        "SystemBC decrypts the first 4 bytes, which can be considered as a header of the C&C command. The header can be divided into 3 main parts: command, secondary command, and data size. The 4 byte that comes after means tokens, and the rest includes command data.",
                        "This post will discuss the analysis of SystemBC type that can currently communicate with the C&C server. To be more precise, it is an analysis of Type 2, which has most of the features of Type 1 and Type 3. The malware was found to be installed through RedLine, packed with the packer that was used for the type distributed through SmokeLoader. SystemBC known to be installed through Emotet is Type 3.",
                        "If the attacker wants to use an infected system as Proxy Bot (using SystemBC of the infected system when accessing a certain address), a command to create proxies will be sent first. SystemBC creates a socket depending on the type when it receives a command to create proxies. The created socket will be managed by index.",

                        "The encrypted data is then sent to the C&C server. SystemBC uses the Raw TCP socket to communicate with the C&C server. When the server receives information from the malware, it uses the same RC4 key to send the encrypted command data. The following is encrypted data sent from the C&C server.",
                        "Ever since SystemBC was distributed through exploit kits in the past, the malware has been installed through other malware strains from malicious websites disguised as download pages for cracks and serials of commercial software until recently. While it was used for attacks targeting normal users, it was also employed by attackers in multiple ransomware attacks targeting companies to achieve their goals.",
                        "It then scans the process named a2guard.exe which is assumed to be a product of Emisoft. If the process is running, it terminates itself and will no longer perform malicious behaviors. Lastly, it copies the binary of the currently running SystemBC as a random name in %ALLUSERSPROFILE% (in the random folder of the ProgramData path) and registers it as a task named certain random string again. The process uses COM objects, TaskScheduler class, and methods of the Task class.",
                        "The role of SystemBC in such an attack is not known in detail. Yet as it can act as a proxy and install additional payloads after downloading them, it might download and execute malicious payloads or be installed in internal networks to perform the role of a proxy. In fact, according to a report made by F-Secure [3] that found an attack using SystemBC, the malware was used for downloading and running PsExec and scripts for lateral movement attacks.",
                        "After the socket is created, the malware will create a new thread and connect to the address it received. The reason the attacker initially named the malware BackConnect is because SystemBC first connects to the attackers server instead of the attacker manually accessing SystemBC to attempt Socks5 proxy connection. Since SystemBC cannot be accessed externally if it is installed in the system of a private IP band, malware strains with the Proxy feature mainly use the Reverse Proxy method.",
                        "The task starts 2 minutes after the current time and is run every 2 minutes. The target that is executed is SystemBC, and designates start as an argument. SystemBC can download payloads in exe form from the C&C server and run them. If the downloaded executable is SystemBC with the latest version, the process then becomes a binary update for SystemBC.",
                        "SystemBC discovered in 2020 was used with Ryuk or Egregor in ransomware attacks. It was also the malware used by the DarkSide ransomware group, which used it to attack Colonial Pipeline, a U.S. pipeline company. [2] Unlike ransomware distributed through exploit kits, web browsers, or spam emails, attackers using this type of malware install ransomware after dominating the company environment system, then demand money. In other words, they dominate the internal network using tools such as Cobalt Strike after the initial infiltration and infect various systems within a company by installing ransomware.",
                        "As shown below, SystemBC first collects the basic information of the infected system. When the currently running SystemBC process is executed as an admin privilege (High Integrity Level or higher), Offset 0x34 among the following items is set as 0x2. If not, it is set as 0.",
                        "SystemBC is a proxy malware that has been used by various attackers for the last few years. While it is recently distributed through SmokeLoader or Emotet, this malware has steadily been used in various ransomware attacks in the past. When an attacker attempts to access a certain address with malicious intent, the system can be used as a passage if the infected system utilizes SystemBC, which acts as a Proxy Bot. Because it can also act as a downloader to install additional malware externally, attackers can also use it to install additional payloads.",
                        "In March 2022, it was found that SystemBC was being installed as an additional payload by Emotet. Emotet is a banking malware that installs additional modules or malware strains to steal credentials from the infected system. Normally, the attackers install Cobalt Strike through Emotet to dominate the infected system, but recently, SystemBC is also being distributed.",

                        "Should the attacker send requests to a certain address later, they will send the created proxy socket with the assigned index. SystemBC will then send the data it received to the address. The data received will be sent to the C&C server through SystemBC. SystemBC thus acts as Proxy Bot, allowing the attacker to hide the IP when performing attacks. If the malware operates in the system that can access internal networks, the networks can be accessed by the external attacker through SystemBC.",

                        "After it is installed, SystemBC stays in the infected system to download additional payloads. Moreover, it can also act as Proxy Bot, meaning that the system can become a passageway for other attackers. Users should apply the latest patch for OS and programs such as Internet browsers, and update V3 to the latest version to prevent malware infection in advance."
