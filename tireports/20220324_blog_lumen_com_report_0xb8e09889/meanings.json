One function it displayed was the ability to edit a registry key (HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run), a common method used by threat actors to persist on an infected machine past reboot. This sample appeared to be the most developed of those in the custom modules and is likely active in the wild given its routable C2 mechanism.

If it was unable to retrieve the next payload, it went to sleep for one second and then tried again. To further evade detection, the next agent was downloaded as a Python file, rather than an executable. Once downloaded onto the infected host Python file decrypted the data using a hard-coded key, and the script changed the file extension from Python to an executable. It then copied the payload to the \\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup folder, granting persistence by initiating the executable whenever the machine was powered on. Lastly, it executed the payload via the command shell. This sample contained a non-routable IP address suggesting it is still in development.",

Since our initial report, Black Lotus Labs continues to monitor the WSL attack surface for new developments. In the last few months, we have identified several different samples that indicate the capability is evolving. Custom developed and open-source tools (OSTs) have added functionality ranging from shellcode injection to keylogging and password stealing that could be used by actors to evade detection while gaining access into endpoints and computer networks. Given the demonstrated interest and the fact that even the samples with valid command and control (C2) infrastructure are evading general detection by AV providers, it is clear this newly proven type of attack remains one to be watched. In particular, because the types of users running WSL tend to have greater network privileges, organizations that utilize WSL as part of their day-to-day operations should take note to better bolster defenses.",

One function it displayed was the ability to edit a registry key (HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run), a common method used by threat actors to persist on an infected machine past reboot.

We assess that at least part of the code was based upon a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) to retrieve stored passwords. While this particular sample did not contain a mechanism for external communications, it allowed the threat actor to harvest stored credentials on the infected machine in this case from the Chrome login database. These stored credentials could be used later to retrieve information or help the actor move laterally if the victim reused passwords. One benefit to this approach over the Discord token grabber is that this module had a detection rate of zero."
