The war in Ukraine has prompted many countries to deploy their cyber capabilities to gain insight about global events, political machinations, and motivations. This desire for situational awareness often extends to collecting intelligence from allies and friends, which could explain why Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) researchers detected what appears to be an attempt by China to deploy advanced malware to computer systems of Russian officials."}

This connection suggests that the filename was chosen to target officials or military personnel familiar with the region."}
