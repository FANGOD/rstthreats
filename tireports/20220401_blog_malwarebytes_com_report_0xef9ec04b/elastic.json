            "text": "Posted: April 1, 2022 by Threat Intelligence Team\nIn late March, the cyber espionage group UNC2589 also known as SaintBear launched a spear phishing campaign targeting several entities in Ukraine. In this blog we review this attack and the intended payloads.\nThis blog post was authored by Ankur Saini, Roberto Santos and Hossein Jazi.\nUAC-0056 also known as SaintBear, UNC2589 and TA471 is a cyber espionage actor that has been active since early 2021 and has mainly targeted Ukraine and Georgia. The group is known to have performed a wiper attack in January 2022 on multiple Ukrainian government computers and websites.\nEarlier in March, Cert-UA reported UAC-0056 activity that targeted state organizations in Ukraine using malicious implants called GrimPlant, GraphSteel as well as CobaltStrike Beacon. Following up with that campaign, SOCPRIME and SentinelOne have reported some similar activities associated with this actor.\nIn late March, the Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence Team identified new activity from this group that targeted several entities in Ukraine, including ICTV, a private TV channel. Unlike previous attacks that were trying to convince victims to open a url and download a first stage payload or distributing fake translation software, in this campaign the threat actor is using a spear phishing attack that contains macro-embedded Excel documents. In this blog post, we provide a technical analysis of this new campaign."

The strings in the binary are encoded and are only decoded when they are required to be used.\nThe dropper decodes the C2 address from a string and then downloads a Base64 encoded binary from the C2 and writes it to C:\\Users\\{user}\\.java-sdk\\java-sdk.exe. This downloaded binary is named as Elephant Downloader by the attackers judging from the strings present. java-sdk.exe is then executed by the dropper with the following arguments, -a 0CyCcrhI/6B5wKE8XLOd+w==. The argument -a refers to address and the Base64 string is the C2 address in AES encrypted format.\nFigure 6: Elephant Dropper"

The main purpose of this payload is to maintain persistence on the system and also deploy the next two stages of the attack. The strings in this executable are encoded in the same way as in the Dropper. It makes itself persistent through the auto-run registry key. To do so, it creates a registry key under \\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run named as Java-SDK with value C:\\Users\\{user}\\Desktop\\java-sdk.exe -a 0CyCcrhI/6B5wKE8XLOd+w==.\nFigure 7: Registry Key for Persistence\nThe downloader is responsible for getting the implant and the client; the URL paths for the payloads are stored in encoded form in the binary. It downloads the implant and the client from http://194.31.98.124:443/m and http://194.31.98.124:443/p respectively in Base64 encoded format.\nAfter this, it decodes the file names which are stored as well in encoded format and creates the file in the earlier mentioned directory .java-sdk. The file name of the implant is oracle-java.exe and the client is microsoft-cortana.exe. The downloader executes both payloads and passes -addr 0CyCcrhI/6B5wKE8XLOd+w== as arguments to both.

            "text": "Elephant Implant (also tracked as GrimPlant backdoor) seems to be one of the most important payloads in this attack. This executable communicates with the C2 on port 80. Similar to earlier payloads, strings are encoded in the same fashion is in this binary as well, and it also gets the C2 address encrypted from its parent process. The implant makes use of gRPC to communicate with the C2, it has a TLS certificate embedded in the binary and makes use of SSL/TLS integration in gRPC. This allows the malware to encrypt all the data that is being sent to the C2 via gRPC.\nFigure 9: Embedded TLS Certificate in the Implant\nThe implant uses the MachineID library to derive a unique id for each machine. It also gets the IP address of the machine by making a request to https://api.ipify.org/.\nIt also collects information related to the OS in a function named GetOSInfo, as part of this the malware collects the hostname, OS name and number of CPUs in the system. A function named GetUserInfo collects the Name, Username and path to Home directory of the current user.\nFigure 10: getSystemInfo function\nThe Implant can communicate with the C2 by using 4 types of RPC requests:\n/Implant/Login This is the initial RPC request that is sent to the C2. Along with this RPC request the earlier retrieved ID and system information is sent to the C2 as well.\n/Implant/FetchCommand This RPC request is used to retrieve the command that the actor wants to execute on the target machine. The retrieved command is executed via %windir%\\SysWOW64\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe. An AdminId and Command to be executed is received as a response to this command.\n/Implant/SendCmdOutput This is used to send the output of an executed command by sending a SendCmdOutput RPC request to the C2. An AdminId and Command Output is sent with this request.\n/Implant/Heartbeat A Heartbeat RPC request is made to C2 to send the status to the C2 at regular intervals. The machine id and system info retrieved earlier is sent with this request.\nFigure 11: RPC Requests"

The functionality suggests that this final payload is a data stealer.\nSimilar to other payloads in this attack chain, this payload receives the C2 server as a parameter in Base64 format (0CyCcrhI/6B5wKE8XLOd+w==) which is AES encrypted format of the server. Decoding the Base64 string gives us the C2 IP address in AES encrypted format: d02c8272b848ffa079c0a13c5cb39dfb. The actor uses the following key to AES decrypt (ECB-NoPadding mode) the C2 address: F1D21960D8EB2FDDF2538D29A5FD50B5F64A3F9BF06F2A3C4C950438C9A7F78E.\nOnce the sample has established its connection with its C2 server, it starts collecting data and exfiltrating them into the server. At first it collects some basic info about the user and send it to the server as shown in Figure 12. (some info has been removed for privacy). The collected data is Base64 encoded, and includes hostname, OS name(windows), number of CPUs, IP address, Name, Username and home directory.\nFigure 12: Collect user info\nAfter that, the client tries to steal credentials from the victims machine. The actor steals data from the following services:\nBrowser credentials\nWiFi information\nCredentials manager data\nMail accounts\nPutty connections data\nFilezilla credentials\nWe have installed some of these services for testing purposes. Figure 13 shows how the stolen data is being sent to C2 server:\nFigure 13: C2 communications\nBase64 decoding data shows what data has been exfiltrated:\nFigure 14: Stolen data\nFor example, to recover Wifi data, the command netsh wlan show profiles (that list all SSIDs saved in the machine) has been used. Once all the SSIDs are gathered, if any, it will launch the command netsh wlan show profile [SSID] key=clear, revealing all saved wifi passwords:\nFigure 15: Wifi data exfiltration commands\nThe following image shows an example of the command execution, where you can see some of the commands executed in the process:\nFigure 16: Used commands\nFigure 17 shows another example of exfiltration in which an encoded PowerShell command is used to steal the data from the Secure Vault:\nFigure 17: PS command for exfiltration\nIn addition to stealing credentials, the actor steals all the files from the victims machine. To collect the data it iterates through all the files in the user directory and hashes each of them. All of these collected hashes will be sent to the actors C2 server. Finally, the malware will send to the attackers all these files.\nNote that all the collected data are AES encrypted before being sent to C2 server, so packet inspection will not reveal any useful information.\nFigure 18: Stealing files activity"
