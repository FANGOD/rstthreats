                        "In late March, the cyber espionage group UNC2589 also known as SaintBear launched a spear phishing campaign targeting several entities in Ukraine. In this blog we review this attack and the intended payloads.",
                        "UAC-0056 aka UNC2589, TA471, or SaintBear is an active actor that has been performing cyber espionage campaigns against Ukraine since 2021. The group is known to have performed the WhisperGate disruptive attack against Ukraine government entities in early 2022. Recently we have observed new activity associated with this actor that used macro-embedded excel documents to drop its malicious software on victims machines. In this blog we provided a technical analysis of this campaign.",

                        "Elephant Downloader is also written in the Go Programming Language and is executed by the Dropper. The main purpose of this payload is to maintain persistence on the system and also deploy the next two stages of the attack. The strings in this executable are encoded in the same way as in the Dropper. It makes itself persistent through the auto-run registry key. To do so, it creates a registry key under \\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run named as Java-SDK with value C:\\Users\\{user}\\Desktop\\java-sdk.exe -a 0CyCcrhI/6B5wKE8XLOd+w==.",

The strings in the binary are encoded and are only decoded when they are required to be used.<crlf>The dropper decodes the C2 address from a string and then downloads a Base64 encoded binary from the C2 and writes it to C:\\Users\\{user}\\.java-sdk\\java-sdk.exe. This downloaded binary is named as Elephant Downloader by the attackers judging from the strings present. java-sdk.exe is then executed by the dropper with the following arguments, -a 0CyCcrhI/6B5wKE8XLOd+w==. The argument -a refers to address and the Base64 string is the C2 address in AES encrypted format.",

This executable is written in the Go programming language and is signed with a stolen Microsoft certificate.

Similar to earlier payloads, strings are encoded in the same fashion is in this binary as well, and it also gets the C2 address encrypted from its parent process. The implant makes use of gRPC to communicate with the C2, it has a TLS certificate embedded in the binary and makes use of SSL/TLS integration in gRPC. This allows the malware to encrypt all the data that is being sent to the C2 via gRPC."
