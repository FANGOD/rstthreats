                        "Snake emerged for the first time in late November 2020. Since November 2020, malicious actors have started releasing Snake through phishing attacks. Snake Ransomware is built-in Golang, an open-source programming language that supports several operating systems. It deletes the computers Shadow Volume Copies and terminates processes linked to SCADA systems, virtual machines, industrial control systems, remote management tools, network management applications, and other programs. This ransomware has been attacking industrial control systems operations and files. Snake bypasses all Windows and other system directories on the machine during encryption. In comparison to other ransomware attacks, its encryption procedure is slower."
