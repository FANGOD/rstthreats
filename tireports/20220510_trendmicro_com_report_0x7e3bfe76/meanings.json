                        "On April 26, Twitter user PCrisk tweeted about the new Black Basta ransomware that appends the extension .basta and changes the desktop wallpaper.",
                        "We have also noticed some similarities between the Black Basta and Black Matter payment sites. Like Black Matter, Black Basta implements user verification on its Tor site. However, the leak site does not implement a session key.",
                        "Threat researchers suggest that the recent attacks by Black Basta can be seen as early manifestations of Contis rebranding efforts. True or not, organizations should keep a watchful eye against ransomware threats. An organizations thorough assessment of its security posture and its implementation of solid cybersecurity defenses give it a better fighting chance against such threats.",
                        "For a newcomer in the field, Black Basta is quite prolific for having compromised at least a dozen organizations in just a few weeks. The groups first known attack using the Black Basta ransomware occurred in the second week of April 2022. But an earlier sample was also spotted back in February 2022 with the ransomware name no_name_software, which appends the extension encrypted to encrypted files. According to some threat researchers, it appears that Black Basta has been in development since early February 2022.",
                        "Figure 3. The registry entry created after Black Basta ransomware changes the wallpaper on the infected machine",
                        "Like other enterprise-focused ransomware operations, Black Basta employs a double extortion scheme that involves exfiltrating confidential data before encryption to threaten victims with public release of the stolen data.",
                        "Black Bastas recent entry to the cybercrime world suggests that information about their operations is still limited. According to a report, the gang has neither started marketing its operations nor has it begun recruitment of affiliates in underground forums. Based on advertisements they posted before the attacks, the malicious actor likely uses stolen credentials purchased in darknet websites or underground forums to get into an organizations system.",
                        "Figure 1. A command prompt is displayed if Black Basta ransomware is not run with administrator rights.",
                        "This blog entry takes a closer look at the Black Basta ransomware and analyzes this newcomers familiar infection techniques.",
                        "On April 20, 2022, a user named Black Basta posted on underground forums known as XSS.IS and EXPLOIT.IN to advertise that it intends to buy and monetize corporate network access credentials for a share of the profits. The advertisement also specified that it was looking for organizations based in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, which are all English-speaking countries. A report noted that malicious actors acquired stolen credentials from some darknet websites that peddle an enormous amount of exfiltrated data to the underground market.",

                        "Security researchers exchanged speculations on Twitter that Black Basta is possibly a rebranding of the Conti ransomware operation. MalwareHunterTeam pointed out many similarities in its leak site, payment site, and negotiation style to those of Contis. Twitter user Arkbird echoed the same observation. Lawrence Abrams of BleepingComputer also mentioned that the malicious actors behind Black Basta seem like they are exerting a lot of effort to avoid any resemblance to their previous identity.",

                        "Black Basta, a new ransomware gang, has swiftly risen to prominence in recent weeks after it caused massive breaches to organizations in a short span of time."

An organizations thorough assessment of its security posture and its implementation of solid cybersecurity defenses give it a better fighting chance against such threats.",

MalwareHunterTeam pointed out many similarities in its leak site, payment site, and negotiation style to those of Contis. Twitter user Arkbird echoed the same observation. Lawrence Abrams of BleepingComputer also mentioned that the malicious actors behind Black Basta seem like they are exerting a lot of effort to avoid any resemblance to their previous identity."

A ransomware typically creates a unique ID for each victim despite being infected by the same executable. Their choice of target organizations also suggests this to be the case. They buy corporate network access credentials in underground markets, which could mean that they do not distribute their malware sporadically.

The advertisement also specified that it was looking for organizations based in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, which are all English-speaking countries.
