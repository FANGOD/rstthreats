                                <li>The BlackByte gang often uses phishing and/or vulnerable unpatched applications or services like vulnerable versions of SonicWall VPN or the ProxyShell vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange servers to gain access to the victim&amp;#39;s network. These are usually known public vulnerabilities that the targets haven&amp;#39;t patched in a timely manner. Due to a lack of logs, we could not confirm the initial infection vector in the case below, but we have indicators that a vulnerable Microsoft Exchange Server was compromised, which matches the previously described behavior of the BlackByte actor.&amp;lt;crlf&amp;gt;A typical timeline of infection looks similar to the anonymized log below, which we saw in our telemetry in March.</li>

The FBI document states &amp;#34;complex.exe -single &amp;lt;SHA256&amp;gt;&amp;#34; launches the infection process. In our case, the parameters are different the first one is a &amp;#39;-a&amp;#39; and the following is not a SHA256 hash, it is an eight-digit number, like &amp;#39;42269874&amp;#39; (not the real number, but similar to keeping the privacy of the victim). This seems to be a victim ID or an offset for the unpacking process. The actual behavior of RANDOMNAME.EXE seems to be very similar to the complexe.exe one described in the FBI report. It also disables Windows Defender. The base64-obfuscated string &amp;#39;VwBpAG4ARABlAGYAZQBuAGQA&amp;#39; decodes to &amp;#39;WinDefend&amp;#39;, which is the Windows Defender service. It then tries to disable Florian Roth&amp;#39;s Raccine ransomware protection tool and a few other commands mentioned in the FBI document.&amp;lt;crlf&amp;gt;Finally, approximately 17 hours after the ransomware infection process started, the machine reboots and the ransomware note &amp;#34;BlackByteRestore.txt&amp;#34; is shown to the user via Notepad.</li>

                                        <li>Cisco Talos has been monitoring the BlackByte Ransomware Group for several months, infecting victims all over the world, from North America to Colombia, Netherlands, China, Mexico and Vietnam.&lt;crlf&gt;The FBI released a joint cybersecurity advisory in February 2022 warning about this group, stating that the group has targeted at least three critical infrastructure sectors in the U.S.&lt;crlf&gt;Talos has monitored ongoing BlackByte attacks dating back to March.&lt;crlf&gt;BlackByte updated its leak site with a new design and new victims and is still actively exploiting victims worldwide.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Talos research and other public reports about BlackByte are mainly pointing to vulnerable, outdated systems as the initial infection vector. This threat shows how important it is to have a proper update strategy in place. If your organization is running a Microsoft Exchange Server or any other internet-facing system, make sure it always has the latest patch in place. The time window between the announcement of a new security vulnerability and its weaponization and use by criminals is getting smaller every year.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The BlackByte gang often uses phishing and/or vulnerable unpatched applications or services like vulnerable versions of SonicWall VPN or the ProxyShell vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange servers to gain access to the victim&#39;s network. These are usually known public vulnerabilities that the targets haven&#39;t patched in a timely manner. Due to a lack of logs, we could not confirm the initial infection vector in the case below, but we have indicators that a vulnerable Microsoft Exchange Server was compromised, which matches the previously described behavior of the BlackByte actor.&lt;crlf&gt;A typical timeline of infection looks similar to the anonymized log below, which we saw in our telemetry in March.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The BlackByte ransomware group uses its software for its own goals and as a ransomware-as-a-service offering to other criminals. The ransomware group and its affiliates have infected victims all over the world, from North America to Colombia, the Netherlands, China, Mexico and Vietnam. Talos has been monitoring BlackByte for several months and we can confirm they are still active after the FBI released a joint cybersecurity advisory in February 2022. Additionally, BlackByte is considered part of the big game ransomware groups, which are targeting large, high-profile targets, looking to exfiltrate internal data and threatening to publicly release it. Like similar groups, they have their own leaks site on the darknet. The actual TOR address of this site is frequently moved. Below, you can see a screenshot of the site. We have anonymized the screenshot to protect victims&#39; privacy.</li>

The former compromised host elevates local and domain account privileges and moves laterally by using standard penetration testing and legit administrator tools (LoLBins).

These tools are also often used by Administrators for legitimate tasks, so it can be difficult to detect them as a malicious threat. It seems to be that executing the actual ransomware is the last step once they are done with lateral movement and make themselves persistent in the network by adding additional admin accounts.&lt;crlf&gt;Unfortunately, we could not obtain the RANDOMNAME_n.EXE files, which are likely stages of the ransomware infection. We also tried to get them via the telemetry of our partners, but the hash was unknown to them, too. This points to the same trend that many big game ransomware groups moved to the tactic of using unique obfuscated files for every victim. The chat with a criminal from the ransomware group Hive we&#39;ve transcribed below provides an idea of how these conversations go. We are releasing more details about conversations with ransomware actors in a future post.</li>

                                        <li>The BlackByte gang often uses phishing and/or vulnerable unpatched applications or services like vulnerable versions of SonicWall VPN or the ProxyShell vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange servers to gain access to the victim&#39;s network. These are usually known public vulnerabilities that the targets haven&#39;t patched in a timely manner. Due to a lack of logs, we could not confirm the initial infection vector in the case below, but we have indicators that a vulnerable Microsoft Exchange Server was compromised, which matches the previously described behavior of the BlackByte actor.&lt;crlf&gt;A typical timeline of infection looks similar to the anonymized log below, which we saw in our telemetry in March.</li>

                                        <li>Cisco Talos has been monitoring the BlackByte Ransomware Group for several months, infecting victims all over the world, from North America to Colombia, Netherlands, China, Mexico and Vietnam.&lt;crlf&gt;The FBI released a joint cybersecurity advisory in February 2022 warning about this group, stating that the group has targeted at least three critical infrastructure sectors in the U.S.&lt;crlf&gt;Talos has monitored ongoing BlackByte attacks dating back to March.&lt;crlf&gt;BlackByte updated its leak site with a new design and new victims and is still actively exploiting victims worldwide.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Assuming that RANDOMNAME.EXE -a &lt;SUSPICIOUS NUMBER&gt; is the start of the ransomware infection process, they have slightly changed their behavior or are just using a different packer. The FBI document states &#34;complex.exe -single &lt;SHA256&gt;&#34; launches the infection process. In our case, the parameters are different the first one is a &#39;-a&#39; and the following is not a SHA256 hash, it is an eight-digit number, like &#39;42269874&#39; (not the real number, but similar to keeping the privacy of the victim). This seems to be a victim ID or an offset for the unpacking process. The actual behavior of RANDOMNAME.EXE seems to be very similar to the complexe.exe one described in the FBI report. It also disables Windows Defender. The base64-obfuscated string &#39;VwBpAG4ARABlAGYAZQBuAGQA&#39; decodes to &#39;WinDefend&#39;, which is the Windows Defender service. It then tries to disable Florian Roth&#39;s Raccine ransomware protection tool and a few other commands mentioned in the FBI document.&lt;crlf&gt;Finally, approximately 17 hours after the ransomware infection process started, the machine reboots and the ransomware note &#34;BlackByteRestore.txt&#34; is shown to the user via Notepad.</li>

                                        <li>The BlackByte ransomware group uses its software for its own goals and as a ransomware-as-a-service offering to other criminals. The ransomware group and its affiliates have infected victims all over the world, from North America to Colombia, the Netherlands, China, Mexico and Vietnam. Talos has been monitoring BlackByte for several months and we can confirm they are still active after the FBI released a joint cybersecurity advisory in February 2022. Additionally, BlackByte is considered part of the big game ransomware groups, which are targeting large, high-profile targets, looking to exfiltrate internal data and threatening to publicly release it. Like similar groups, they have their own leaks site on the darknet. The actual TOR address of this site is frequently moved. Below, you can see a screenshot of the site. We have anonymized the screenshot to protect victims&#39; privacy.</li>

These tools are also often used by Administrators for legitimate tasks, so it can be difficult to detect them as a malicious threat. It seems to be that executing the actual ransomware is the last step once they are done with lateral movement and make themselves persistent in the network by adding additional admin accounts.&lt;crlf&gt;Unfortunately, we could not obtain the RANDOMNAME_n.EXE files, which are likely stages of the ransomware infection. We also tried to get them via the telemetry of our partners, but the hash was unknown to them, too. This points to the same trend that many big game ransomware groups moved to the tactic of using unique obfuscated files for every victim. The chat with a criminal from the ransomware group Hive we&#39;ve transcribed below provides an idea of how these conversations go. We are releasing more details about conversations with ransomware actors in a future post.</li>

These tools are also often used by Administrators for legitimate tasks, so it can be difficult to detect them as a malicious threat. It seems to be that executing the actual ransomware is the last step once they are done with lateral movement and make themselves persistent in the network by adding additional admin accounts.&lt;crlf&gt;Unfortunately, we could not obtain the RANDOMNAME_n.EXE files, which are likely stages of the ransomware infection. We also tried to get them via the telemetry of our partners, but the hash was unknown to them, too. This points to the same trend that many big game ransomware groups moved to the tactic of using unique obfuscated files for every victim. The chat with a criminal from the ransomware group Hive we&#39;ve transcribed below provides an idea of how these conversations go. We are releasing more details about conversations with ransomware actors in a future post.</li>

The FBI document states &#34;complex.exe -single &lt;SHA256&gt;&#34; launches the infection process. In our case, the parameters are different the first one is a &#39;-a&#39; and the following is not a SHA256 hash, it is an eight-digit number, like &#39;42269874&#39; (not the real number, but similar to keeping the privacy of the victim). This seems to be a victim ID or an offset for the unpacking process. The actual behavior of RANDOMNAME.EXE seems to be very similar to the complexe.exe one described in the FBI report. It also disables Windows Defender. The base64-obfuscated string &#39;VwBpAG4ARABlAGYAZQBuAGQA&#39; decodes to &#39;WinDefend&#39;, which is the Windows Defender service. It then tries to disable Florian Roth&#39;s Raccine ransomware protection tool and a few other commands mentioned in the FBI document.&lt;crlf&gt;Finally, approximately 17 hours after the ransomware infection process started, the machine reboots and the ransomware note &#34;BlackByteRestore.txt&#34; is shown to the user via Notepad.</li>

The FBI document states &#34;complex.exe -single &lt;SHA256&gt;&#34; launches the infection process. In our case, the parameters are different the first one is a &#39;-a&#39; and the following is not a SHA256 hash, it is an eight-digit number, like &#39;42269874&#39; (not the real number, but similar to keeping the privacy of the victim). This seems to be a victim ID or an offset for the unpacking process. The actual behavior of RANDOMNAME.EXE seems to be very similar to the complexe.exe one described in the FBI report. It also disables Windows Defender. The base64-obfuscated string &#39;VwBpAG4ARABlAGYAZQBuAGQA&#39; decodes to &#39;WinDefend&#39;, which is the Windows Defender service. It then tries to disable Florian Roth&#39;s Raccine ransomware protection tool and a few other commands mentioned in the FBI document.&lt;crlf&gt;Finally, approximately 17 hours after the ransomware infection process started, the machine reboots and the ransomware note &#34;BlackByteRestore.txt&#34; is shown to the user via Notepad.</li>

These tools are also often used by Administrators for legitimate tasks, so it can be difficult to detect them as a malicious threat. It seems to be that executing the actual ransomware is the last step once they are done with lateral movement and make themselves persistent in the network by adding additional admin accounts.&lt;crlf&gt;Unfortunately, we could not obtain the RANDOMNAME_n.EXE files, which are likely stages of the ransomware infection. We also tried to get them via the telemetry of our partners, but the hash was unknown to them, too. This points to the same trend that many big game ransomware groups moved to the tactic of using unique obfuscated files for every victim. The chat with a criminal from the ransomware group Hive we&#39;ve transcribed below provides an idea of how these conversations go. We are releasing more details about conversations with ransomware actors in a future post.</li>

                                        <li>The BlackByte ransomware group uses its software for its own goals and as a ransomware-as-a-service offering to other criminals. The ransomware group and its affiliates have infected victims all over the world, from North America to Colombia, the Netherlands, China, Mexico and Vietnam. Talos has been monitoring BlackByte for several months and we can confirm they are still active after the FBI released a joint cybersecurity advisory in February 2022. Additionally, BlackByte is considered part of the big game ransomware groups, which are targeting large, high-profile targets, looking to exfiltrate internal data and threatening to publicly release it. Like similar groups, they have their own leaks site on the darknet. The actual TOR address of this site is frequently moved. Below, you can see a screenshot of the site. We have anonymized the screenshot to protect victims&#39; privacy.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The BlackByte gang often uses phishing and/or vulnerable unpatched applications or services like vulnerable versions of SonicWall VPN or the ProxyShell vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange servers to gain access to the victim&#39;s network. These are usually known public vulnerabilities that the targets haven&#39;t patched in a timely manner. Due to a lack of logs, we could not confirm the initial infection vector in the case below, but we have indicators that a vulnerable Microsoft Exchange Server was compromised, which matches the previously described behavior of the BlackByte actor.&lt;crlf&gt;A typical timeline of infection looks similar to the anonymized log below, which we saw in our telemetry in March.</li>

                                        <li>The BlackByte gang often uses phishing and/or vulnerable unpatched applications or services like vulnerable versions of SonicWall VPN or the ProxyShell vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange servers to gain access to the victim&#39;s network. These are usually known public vulnerabilities that the targets haven&#39;t patched in a timely manner. Due to a lack of logs, we could not confirm the initial infection vector in the case below, but we have indicators that a vulnerable Microsoft Exchange Server was compromised, which matches the previously described behavior of the BlackByte actor.&lt;crlf&gt;A typical timeline of infection looks similar to the anonymized log below, which we saw in our telemetry in March.</li>

These tools are also often used by Administrators for legitimate tasks, so it can be difficult to detect them as a malicious threat. It seems to be that executing the actual ransomware is the last step once they are done with lateral movement and make themselves persistent in the network by adding additional admin accounts.&lt;crlf&gt;Unfortunately, we could not obtain the RANDOMNAME_n.EXE files, which are likely stages of the ransomware infection. We also tried to get them via the telemetry of our partners, but the hash was unknown to them, too. This points to the same trend that many big game ransomware groups moved to the tactic of using unique obfuscated files for every victim. The chat with a criminal from the ransomware group Hive we&#39;ve transcribed below provides an idea of how these conversations go. We are releasing more details about conversations with ransomware actors in a future post.</li>

The FBI document states &#34;complex.exe -single &lt;SHA256&gt;&#34; launches the infection process. In our case, the parameters are different the first one is a &#39;-a&#39; and the following is not a SHA256 hash, it is an eight-digit number, like &#39;42269874&#39; (not the real number, but similar to keeping the privacy of the victim). This seems to be a victim ID or an offset for the unpacking process. The actual behavior of RANDOMNAME.EXE seems to be very similar to the complexe.exe one described in the FBI report. It also disables Windows Defender. The base64-obfuscated string &#39;VwBpAG4ARABlAGYAZQBuAGQA&#39; decodes to &#39;WinDefend&#39;, which is the Windows Defender service. It then tries to disable Florian Roth&#39;s Raccine ransomware protection tool and a few other commands mentioned in the FBI document.&lt;crlf&gt;Finally, approximately 17 hours after the ransomware infection process started, the machine reboots and the ransomware note &#34;BlackByteRestore.txt&#34; is shown to the user via Notepad.</li>

The FBI document states &#34;complex.exe -single &lt;SHA256&gt;&#34; launches the infection process. In our case, the parameters are different the first one is a &#39;-a&#39; and the following is not a SHA256 hash, it is an eight-digit number, like &#39;42269874&#39; (not the real number, but similar to keeping the privacy of the victim). This seems to be a victim ID or an offset for the unpacking process. The actual behavior of RANDOMNAME.EXE seems to be very similar to the complexe.exe one described in the FBI report. It also disables Windows Defender. The base64-obfuscated string &#39;VwBpAG4ARABlAGYAZQBuAGQA&#39; decodes to &#39;WinDefend&#39;, which is the Windows Defender service. It then tries to disable Florian Roth&#39;s Raccine ransomware protection tool and a few other commands mentioned in the FBI document.&lt;crlf&gt;Finally, approximately 17 hours after the ransomware infection process started, the machine reboots and the ransomware note &#34;BlackByteRestore.txt&#34; is shown to the user via Notepad.</li>
