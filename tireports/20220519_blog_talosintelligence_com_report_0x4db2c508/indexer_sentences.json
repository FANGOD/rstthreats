BlackByte updated its leak site with a new design and new victims and is still actively exploiting victims worldwide."}

Talos has been monitoring BlackByte for several months and we can confirm they are still active after the FBI released a joint cybersecurity advisory in February 2022. Additionally, BlackByte is considered part of the big game ransomware groups, which are targeting large, high-profile targets, looking to exfiltrate internal data and threatening to publicly release it. Like similar groups, they have their own leaks site on the darknet. The actual TOR address of this site is frequently moved. Below, you can see a screenshot of the site. We have anonymized the screenshot to protect victims' privacy."}

These tools are also often used by Administrators for legitimate tasks, so it can be difficult to detect them as a malicious threat. It seems to be that executing the actual ransomware is the last step once they are done with lateral movement and make themselves persistent in the network by adding additional admin accounts. Unfortunately, we could not obtain the RANDOMNAME_n.EXE files, which are likely stages of the ransomware infection. We also tried to get them via the telemetry of our partners, but the hash was unknown to them, too. This points to the same trend that many big game ransomware groups moved to the tactic of using unique obfuscated files for every victim. The chat with a criminal from the ransomware group Hive we've transcribed below provides an idea of how these conversations go. We are releasing more details about conversations with ransomware actors in a future post."}

In our case, the parameters are different the first one is a '-a' and the following is not a SHA256 hash, it is an eight-digit number, like '42269874' (not the real number, but similar to keeping the privacy of the victim). This seems to be a victim ID or an offset for the unpacking process. The actual behavior of RANDOMNAME.EXE seems to be very similar to the complexe.exe one described in the FBI report. It also disables Windows Defender. The base64-obfuscated string 'VwBpAG4ARABlAGYAZQBuAGQA' decodes to 'WinDefend', which is the Windows Defender service. It then tries to disable Florian Roth's Raccine ransomware protection tool and a few other commands mentioned in the FBI document. Finally, approximately 17 hours after the ransomware infection process started, the machine reboots and the ransomware note \"BlackByteRestore.txt\" is shown to the user via Notepad."}
