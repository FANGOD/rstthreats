            "text": "Hacking forums often double up as underground marketplaces where cybercriminals buy, rent, and sell all kinds of malicious illegal products, including software, trojans, stealers, exploits, and leaked credentials. Malware-as-a-service has contributed substantially to the growth of ransomware and phishing attacks (among other attack types) in the past year, as they lower the technical barrier to entry for criminals to carry out attacks.\nWhile recently perusing one of these hacking forums during regular research activities, the Zscaler ThreatLabz team came across BlackGuard, a sophisticated stealer, advertised for sale. Blackguard is currently being sold as malware-as-a-service with a lifetime price of $700 and a monthly price of $200.\nBlackGuard has the capability to steal all types of information related to Crypto wallets, VPN, Messengers, FTP credentials, saved browser credentials, and email clients.\nIn this blog, we share analysis and screenshots of the techniques this stealer uses to steal information and evade detection using obfuscation, as well as techniques used for anti-debugging.\nFig 1.

We also recommend training end users on the following:\nDont use the same passwords for all the services and replace them on a regular cadence.\nUse multi-factor authentication where applicable.\nAvoid visiting unknown sites.\nAvoid opening suspicious unknown files."
