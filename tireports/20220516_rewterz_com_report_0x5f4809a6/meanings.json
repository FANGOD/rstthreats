                        "Raspberry Robin is a new Windows virus found by researchers having worm-like capabilities that spreads via removable USB devices. Raspberry Robin makes use of Windows Installer to connect to QNAP-related domains and download a malicious DLL. TOR exit nodes are used as a backup C2 infrastructure by this malware.<crlf>Raspberry Robin was first discovered in September 2021. This malware is observed targeting companies in the technology and manufacturing industries. The Raspberry Robin worm appears as a shortcut .lnk file masquerading as a legitimate folder on the infected USB device.<crlf>The UserAssist registry item is updated shortly after the Raspberry Robin infected disc is attached to the system, and when decoded, it records the execution of a ROT13-ciphered value referencing a.lnk file. For example q:\\erpbirel.yax deciphers to d:\\recovery.lnk.<crlf>Raspberry Robin reads and executes a file from the infected external drive using cmd.exe and it utilizes msiexec.exe for external network communication to a rogue domain used as C2 to download and install a DLL library file. After that msiexec.exe runs fodhelper.exe, a Windows utility, which runs rundll32.exe to run a malicious operation. Fodhelper.exe processes run with elevated administrator rights without necessitating a User Account Control prompt, according to experts."

                        "Raspberry Robin is a new Windows virus found by researchers having worm-like capabilities that spreads via removable USB devices. Raspberry Robin makes use of Windows Installer to connect to QNAP-related domains and download a malicious DLL. TOR exit nodes are used as a backup C2 infrastructure by this malware.<crlf>Raspberry Robin was first discovered in September 2021. This malware is observed targeting companies in the technology and manufacturing industries. The Raspberry Robin worm appears as a shortcut .lnk file masquerading as a legitimate folder on the infected USB device.<crlf>The UserAssist registry item is updated shortly after the Raspberry Robin infected disc is attached to the system, and when decoded, it records the execution of a ROT13-ciphered value referencing a.lnk file. For example q:\\erpbirel.yax deciphers to d:\\recovery.lnk.<crlf>Raspberry Robin reads and executes a file from the infected external drive using cmd.exe and it utilizes msiexec.exe for external network communication to a rogue domain used as C2 to download and install a DLL library file. After that msiexec.exe runs fodhelper.exe, a Windows utility, which runs rundll32.exe to run a malicious operation. Fodhelper.exe processes run with elevated administrator rights without necessitating a User Account Control prompt, according to experts."

                        "Raspberry Robin is a new Windows virus found by researchers having worm-like capabilities that spreads via removable USB devices. Raspberry Robin makes use of Windows Installer to connect to QNAP-related domains and download a malicious DLL. TOR exit nodes are used as a backup C2 infrastructure by this malware.<crlf>Raspberry Robin was first discovered in September 2021. This malware is observed targeting companies in the technology and manufacturing industries. The Raspberry Robin worm appears as a shortcut .lnk file masquerading as a legitimate folder on the infected USB device.<crlf>The UserAssist registry item is updated shortly after the Raspberry Robin infected disc is attached to the system, and when decoded, it records the execution of a ROT13-ciphered value referencing a.lnk file. For example q:\\erpbirel.yax deciphers to d:\\recovery.lnk.<crlf>Raspberry Robin reads and executes a file from the infected external drive using cmd.exe and it utilizes msiexec.exe for external network communication to a rogue domain used as C2 to download and install a DLL library file. After that msiexec.exe runs fodhelper.exe, a Windows utility, which runs rundll32.exe to run a malicious operation. Fodhelper.exe processes run with elevated administrator rights without necessitating a User Account Control prompt, according to experts."
