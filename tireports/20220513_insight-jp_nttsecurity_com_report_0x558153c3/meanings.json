                        "APT29 is an APT group said to attribute to Russia [11] and their attacks have been rarely reported in Japan. However, recent Ukraine situation could motivate them to attack Japan. It is already reported that APT29 used LNK [12] or ISO files [13] in their attacks. They are also known as leveraging Cobalt Strike [14] or Golang malwares [15]. These characteristics have some points in common with the discussing campaign.",

Because its infrastructure, domain, file path, HTTP header and Cobalt Strike Config are the same as those of discussing campaign, it could relate to the campaign.",

This User-Agent was that of Yandex Browser which was uncommon in Japan. We found a sample that had same characteristics was posted to VirusTotal from Japan in January 2022. Because there are similarities in their infrastructure, this event could also be related to the discussing campaign.",

They are continuously attacking Japanese media companies or think tanks. They perform spear phishing attacks using Japanese emails and decoy files, execute multistage downloaders and loaders using LNK files. Based on the similarities of these characteristics, we suspect that DarkHotel is related to the discussing campaign.",

It is said that Kimsuky targets North Korean refugees and related organizations, but Japanese media companies had also been targeted in the past. It is reported that they used LNK files in their recent attacks [10]. These characteristics have several points in common with the discussing campaign.",
                        "There are various characteristics, but what we should pay attention to is the fact that this campaign clearly targets Japan. The attacker selected target users carefully, prepared decoy files written in natural Japanese and leveraged Japanese IP addresses. It was apparent that Japan was not attacked just by accident, and the attacker was highly motivated to attack Japan. The access to the Web server used in this campaign might have been limited based on geological information, which suggests the attackers carefulness and slyness. Because there are only a few APT groups that have capability and motivation to attack Japan, the candidate APT groups are limited.",
                        "Our SOC observed APT campaign targeting Japanese companies starting from mid of April 2022. We think that this campaign had already started in March 2022 and related attack might have performed around October 2021. It implies that this campaign is not temporary nor intensive, and it could continue from here forward.",
                        "As of April 2022, an APT campaign targeting Japanese companies has been observed. Though we named several candidate APT groups that can be active behind the campaign, there is no clear evidence that tells which one. Because the similar attacks could have been performed for several months, it is necessary to monitor the situation continuously."

It was apparent that Japan was not attacked just by accident, and the attacker was highly motivated to attack Japan. The access to the Web server used in this campaign might have been limited based on geological information, which suggests the attackers carefulness and slyness. Because there are only a few APT groups that have capability and motivation to attack Japan, the candidate APT groups are limited.",
