                        "The following screenshot (Figure 3) presents an example of these similarities with a side-by-side comparison of the decompiled main thread of both samples. On the left side we have the Industroyer sample from 2016, while on the right we have the Industroyer2 sample from 2022.",
                        "The process killing functionality that Industroyer implements in the main thread, in Industroyer2 has been factored out into the thread that eventually spawns this main thread. What stands out the most though, is the usage of a structure that we renamed main_config in both the samples which stores data used globally throughout the execution. The main_config structure as found in Industroyer2 has been updated to hold additional fields, but it shares the same blueprint of Industroyer.",
                        "Before we present evidence that will link the two samples, we will first focus on the main task of Industroyer2, namely manipulating IEC-104 Information Object Address (IOA).",
                        "The Industroyer2 sample with sha256 d69665f56ddef7ad4e71971f06432e59f1510a7194386e5f0e8926aea7b88e00 has an overwhelming number of similarities with the Industroyer sample called 104.dll and sha256 7907dd95c1d36cf3dc842a1bd804f0db511a0f68f4b3d382c23a3c974a383cad. This is a strong indication that the same threat actor had access to the source code.",
                        "we gave a high-level overview of Industroyer2, the latest tool that advanced persistent threat (APT) group Sandworm used to target the Ukrainian power grid. As the name coined by ESET suggests, this sample presents many commonalities with its predecessor Industroyer, which was used in the notorious December 2016 attack on Ukraines grid. In this blog, we will compare the two samples by providing a side-by-side analysis to uncover the similarities, which helps us gain more insight into the mind of the attacker.",
                        "Nozomi Networks Labs analysis of Industroyer2 suggests that the threat actors had a fairly complete understanding of the security measures deployed in the target environment.",
                        "The window between initial access and when Industroyer2 was launched is unknown. However, we can assume that the window between access and attack was within days rather than hours, based on the malicious activity.",

                        "Unlike Industroyer, which targeted IEC-101, IEC-104, IEC 61850 and OPC Data Access mostly through different Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) (i.e.101.dll, 104.dll, 61850.dll, OPC.exe and OPCClientDemo.dll), the malware dubbed Industroyer2 is a standalone executable which exclusively targets IEC-104.",

Industroyer (left) and Industroyer2 (right) technical comparison of decompiled code which creates STARTDT frame.<crlf>We can conclude that the threat actor does not aspire to be stealthy and is not concerned about obfuscating the malware activity or the similarities between Industroyer and Industroyer2.",

As the name coined by ESET suggests, this sample presents many commonalities with its predecessor Industroyer, which was used in the notorious December 2016 attack on Ukraines grid. In this blog, we will compare the two samples by providing a side-by-side analysis to uncover the similarities, which helps us gain more insight into the mind of the attacker."
