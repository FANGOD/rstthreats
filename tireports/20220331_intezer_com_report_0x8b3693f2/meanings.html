                                        <li>Alert triage Automatically analyze files, URLs, and machines to classify threats and threat actors. Intezer has a false positive rate of 0.2%, effectively eliminating false positives triggered by EDR or other detection systems to ensure your team can focus on real threats.<br/>Incident Response Teams can see an immediate improvement in Mean Time to Respond (MTTR), with automated extraction of IoCs and detection content. Teams using Intezer see alert triage time reduced by up to 90%.<br/>Threat Hunting With 10,124 mapped threat actors and malware families (and growing daily), Intezer allows your team to track threats of interest and leverage a feed of high-quality detection opportunities based on genetic code analysis.<br/>Knowledge Retention The cost of lost knowledge due to turnover is high, so teams need a way to preserve data over time. With access to a central source of knowledge for all micro-artifacts ever seen in the past, IR teams can easily make connections between separate incidents and even new analysts can provide deeper, historic context.</li>

Not wasting time on false positives, noise, or previously seen threats. With more automation in your toolset, you can eliminate time wasted on low priority alerts, reduce pressures that lead to turnover, close skill gaps, and retain historical data.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The promise of automation is a strong draw, as more and more security teams look for ways to introduce automation into their workflows. With constant streams of alerts to triage and investigate, SOC and incident response teams are often overwhelmed. While cybersecurity tools have evolved, we have resource shortages in the industry, skill gaps, and knowledge lost to turnover. And many organizations still struggle with a steady volume of false positives and noise that lead to wasted time.</li>

                                        <li>Alert triage Automatically analyze files, URLs, and machines to classify threats and threat actors. Intezer has a false positive rate of 0.2%, effectively eliminating false positives triggered by EDR or other detection systems to ensure your team can focus on real threats.<br/>Incident Response Teams can see an immediate improvement in Mean Time to Respond (MTTR), with automated extraction of IoCs and detection content. Teams using Intezer see alert triage time reduced by up to 90%.<br/>Threat Hunting With 10,124 mapped threat actors and malware families (and growing daily), Intezer allows your team to track threats of interest and leverage a feed of high-quality detection opportunities based on genetic code analysis.<br/>Knowledge Retention The cost of lost knowledge due to turnover is high, so teams need a way to preserve data over time. With access to a central source of knowledge for all micro-artifacts ever seen in the past, IR teams can easily make connections between separate incidents and even new analysts can provide deeper, historic context.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Using a traditional toolset of paid or free tools takes an analyst at least 30-60 minutes to classify and identify each new alert or threat. Validating, investigating, identifying detection content, and creating detection rules for each threat could require a set of complex tools and unavailable skills, including virtual machines, behavioral analysis, and code analysis tools like disassemblers, debuggers, and memory forensics.</li>

                                        <li>Alert triage Automatically analyze files, URLs, and machines to classify threats and threat actors. Intezer has a false positive rate of 0.2%, effectively eliminating false positives triggered by EDR or other detection systems to ensure your team can focus on real threats.<br/>Incident Response Teams can see an immediate improvement in Mean Time to Respond (MTTR), with automated extraction of IoCs and detection content. Teams using Intezer see alert triage time reduced by up to 90%.<br/>Threat Hunting With 10,124 mapped threat actors and malware families (and growing daily), Intezer allows your team to track threats of interest and leverage a feed of high-quality detection opportunities based on genetic code analysis.<br/>Knowledge Retention The cost of lost knowledge due to turnover is high, so teams need a way to preserve data over time. With access to a central source of knowledge for all micro-artifacts ever seen in the past, IR teams can easily make connections between separate incidents and even new analysts can provide deeper, historic context.</li>

Meanwhile, teams using Intezer only spend on average 9% percent of that time on false positives.<br/>Mean Time to Respond: MTTR decreases by 89% for teams using Intezer, compared to their previous MTTR before using Intezer.<br/>Cost Savings of Potential Incident Data breach costs hit $4.24 million on average in 2021, a record high. The same research noted that costs were significantly lower than that average for some organizations which had a more mature security posture, while organizations that lagged in security areas such as automation experienced higher costs.

                                        <li>Alert triage Automatically analyze files, URLs, and machines to classify threats and threat actors. Intezer has a false positive rate of 0.2%, effectively eliminating false positives triggered by EDR or other detection systems to ensure your team can focus on real threats.<br/>Incident Response Teams can see an immediate improvement in Mean Time to Respond (MTTR), with automated extraction of IoCs and detection content. Teams using Intezer see alert triage time reduced by up to 90%.<br/>Threat Hunting With 10,124 mapped threat actors and malware families (and growing daily), Intezer allows your team to track threats of interest and leverage a feed of high-quality detection opportunities based on genetic code analysis.<br/>Knowledge Retention The cost of lost knowledge due to turnover is high, so teams need a way to preserve data over time. With access to a central source of knowledge for all micro-artifacts ever seen in the past, IR teams can easily make connections between separate incidents and even new analysts can provide deeper, historic context.</li>
