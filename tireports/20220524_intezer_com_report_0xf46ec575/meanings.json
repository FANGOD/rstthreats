                        "Microsoft Office files Utilize the macros or embedded OLE objects to deliver threats such as Emotet or Trickbot. To properly analyze these files you need to understand the format and the techniques threat actors implement to hide malware check out our previous blog about how to analyze malicious office files.<crlf>PDFs By nature these files can have links, JavaScript code, and any file type can be embedded into a PDF file. All of these features are used by threat actors to hide and deliver threats. On top of that, there are hundreds of PDF readers and many known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by specially crafted PDF files and allow threat actors to execute code on an endpoint. There are tools and methods to inspect PDF files and identify malicious files, check out this post about how to analyze PDF files.<crlf>ZIP and RAR archive files These are compressed file formats, a malicious executable can be compressed and attached to an email using one of the archive types. But a well-configured email gateway should be able to alert and possibly prevent the email from arriving at its final destination. But thats not always the case for password-protected archive files, which usually are not blocked, as its contents are not able to be inspected due to encryption. Another technique threat actors use to evade detection is sending one archive that contains a decoy file and another archive that contains the actual malware. This technique was used by the group behind NanoCore RAT.<crlf>ISO and IMG disk image These files are commonly used by attackers to evade detection from email-based Antivirus scanners. The use of ISO files allows the threat actor to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web controls, resulting in execution of the malware without warning to the user. In addition, starting from Windows 8.1, double clicking the file will automatically mount the ISO file and install the software (malware in the case of malicious files). Threat actors use this format to evade detection while fairly easily installing malware."

To: Recipients name and email address. This field can help in determining the real target of an email, in case we determine that the email is malicious the recipient can determine if the attack targets specific victims. Received: The most reliable field that provides information about the origin of the email. An email that is being sent from one user to another passes through one or more servers until it reaches its destination, similar to post offices. Each agent adds a layer of information that contains a timestamp and information about the server from which the email was received from, thats the reason that some emails contain several Received fields. Therefore, you should inspect the header from the bottom to the top. Return-Path: Address to return the mail. DKIM signature: Checks the DKIM DNS record of the sender to confirm the authenticity of the sender using public key cryptography. SPF: Defines which mail servers are authorized to send emails for a certain domain based on DNS record, the goal is to prevent attackers from sending emails using your domain from any server. Received-SPF field email sent from permitted servers will show up as Pass but it can still be a non legitimate email if the account has been compromised. If the value of the field is either Fail or Softfail, it indicates that the email may be spoofed or the domains didnt update their SPF records. Here is an example of an email that pretends to be sent by Haesung Tech, but the address is spoofed and the doesnt pass the SPF check:",

In other cases, the links are hidden behind text or images such as buttons or coupons, making it harder to notice the malicious URL.",

If it is a known malicious address then the email is certainly malicious as well. But if the results are not conclusive or you wish to dig deeper, it is worth to further investigate the domain and see if it was linked to any known campaigns or threat actors.",
                        "As described above, emails support a wide variety of attachments, and these files can contain malicious code (especially executables or scripts). Commonly the email provider will alert upon opening emails that contain executables. But thats not always the case for documents like pdfs and Office files which are often used and shared between organizations and individuals. These non-binary files are also commonly used by threat actors to deliver malicious payloads, and using different techniques, execute the first stage of the attack."

To: Recipients name and email address. This field can help in determining the real target of an email, in case we determine that the email is malicious the recipient can determine if the attack targets specific victims. Received: The most reliable field that provides information about the origin of the email. An email that is being sent from one user to another passes through one or more servers until it reaches its destination, similar to post offices. Each agent adds a layer of information that contains a timestamp and information about the server from which the email was received from, thats the reason that some emails contain several Received fields. Therefore, you should inspect the header from the bottom to the top. Return-Path: Address to return the mail. DKIM signature: Checks the DKIM DNS record of the sender to confirm the authenticity of the sender using public key cryptography. SPF: Defines which mail servers are authorized to send emails for a certain domain based on DNS record, the goal is to prevent attackers from sending emails using your domain from any server. Received-SPF field email sent from permitted servers will show up as Pass but it can still be a non legitimate email if the account has been compromised. If the value of the field is either Fail or Softfail, it indicates that the email may be spoofed or the domains didnt update their SPF records. Here is an example of an email that pretends to be sent by Haesung Tech, but the address is spoofed and the doesnt pass the SPF check:"

                        "Microsoft Office files Utilize the macros or embedded OLE objects to deliver threats such as Emotet or Trickbot. To properly analyze these files you need to understand the format and the techniques threat actors implement to hide malware check out our previous blog about how to analyze malicious office files.<crlf>PDFs By nature these files can have links, JavaScript code, and any file type can be embedded into a PDF file. All of these features are used by threat actors to hide and deliver threats. On top of that, there are hundreds of PDF readers and many known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by specially crafted PDF files and allow threat actors to execute code on an endpoint. There are tools and methods to inspect PDF files and identify malicious files, check out this post about how to analyze PDF files.<crlf>ZIP and RAR archive files These are compressed file formats, a malicious executable can be compressed and attached to an email using one of the archive types. But a well-configured email gateway should be able to alert and possibly prevent the email from arriving at its final destination. But thats not always the case for password-protected archive files, which usually are not blocked, as its contents are not able to be inspected due to encryption. Another technique threat actors use to evade detection is sending one archive that contains a decoy file and another archive that contains the actual malware. This technique was used by the group behind NanoCore RAT.<crlf>ISO and IMG disk image These files are commonly used by attackers to evade detection from email-based Antivirus scanners. The use of ISO files allows the threat actor to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web controls, resulting in execution of the malware without warning to the user. In addition, starting from Windows 8.1, double clicking the file will automatically mount the ISO file and install the software (malware in the case of malicious files). Threat actors use this format to evade detection while fairly easily installing malware."

The URL redirects to a Command and control (C2) where a ZIP file or malicious document is hosted. The ZIP file contains a malicious file and in some emails also a harmless PDF file. The malicious attachment varies between RTF, DOC, PDF, JS, LNK or EXE. The main goal of the attachment is to drop the packed payloads from the C2.

To properly analyze these files you need to understand the format and the techniques threat actors implement to hide malware check out our previous blog about how to analyze malicious office files.<crlf>PDFs By nature these files can have links, JavaScript code, and any file type can be embedded into a PDF file. All of these features are used by threat actors to hide and deliver threats. On top of that, there are hundreds of PDF readers and many known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by specially crafted PDF files and allow threat actors to execute code on an endpoint. There are tools and methods to inspect PDF files and identify malicious files, check out this post about how to analyze PDF files.<crlf>ZIP and RAR archive files These are compressed file formats, a malicious executable can be compressed and attached to an email using one of the archive types. But a well-configured email gateway should be able to alert and possibly prevent the email from arriving at its final destination. But thats not always the case for password-protected archive files, which usually are not blocked, as its contents are not able to be inspected due to encryption. Another technique threat actors use to evade detection is sending one archive that contains a decoy file and another archive that contains the actual malware. This technique was used by the group behind NanoCore RAT.<crlf>ISO and IMG disk image These files are commonly used by attackers to evade detection from email-based Antivirus scanners. The use of ISO files allows the threat actor to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web controls, resulting in execution of the malware without warning to the user. In addition, starting from Windows 8.1, double clicking the file will automatically mount the ISO file and install the software (malware in the case of malicious files). Threat actors use this format to evade detection while fairly easily installing malware."

To: Recipients name and email address. This field can help in determining the real target of an email, in case we determine that the email is malicious the recipient can determine if the attack targets specific victims. Received: The most reliable field that provides information about the origin of the email. An email that is being sent from one user to another passes through one or more servers until it reaches its destination, similar to post offices. Each agent adds a layer of information that contains a timestamp and information about the server from which the email was received from, thats the reason that some emails contain several Received fields. Therefore, you should inspect the header from the bottom to the top. Return-Path: Address to return the mail. DKIM signature: Checks the DKIM DNS record of the sender to confirm the authenticity of the sender using public key cryptography. SPF: Defines which mail servers are authorized to send emails for a certain domain based on DNS record, the goal is to prevent attackers from sending emails using your domain from any server. Received-SPF field email sent from permitted servers will show up as Pass but it can still be a non legitimate email if the account has been compromised. If the value of the field is either Fail or Softfail, it indicates that the email may be spoofed or the domains didnt update their SPF records. Here is an example of an email that pretends to be sent by Haesung Tech, but the address is spoofed and the doesnt pass the SPF check:"
