                        "As in most ransomware cases, the encryption routine runs in several threads. It uses an I/O Completion Ports model to achieve faster encryption. According to Microsoft: I/O completion ports provide an efficient threading model for processing multiple asynchronous I/O requests on a multiprocessor system. When a process creates an I/O completion port, the system creates an associated queue object for requests whose sole purpose is to service these requests. Processes that handle many concurrent asynchronous I/O requests can do so more quickly and efficiently by using I/O completion ports in conjunction with a pre-allocated thread pool than by creating threads at the time they receive an I/O request.",

Unlike other RaaS groups, SunCrypt runs a small and closed affiliate program. The first version of this ransomware was written in GO, but after C and C++ versions were released in mid-2020, the group became much more active. SunCrypt mostly affects the Services, Technology, and Retail industries. Our researchers recently identified an updated version of this ransomware which includes additional capabilities."
