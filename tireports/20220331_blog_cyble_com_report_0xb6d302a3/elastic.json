Refer to Figure 1.\nFigure 1 Requesting Users Information\nWhile monitoring the traffic, we identified that these details were being uploaded to the server through URL: hxxps://srqc[.]online/controller/api/common/insert2.php, as shown in the below figure.\nFigure 2 User Information Sent to the Server\nAs this malicious activity is based on the Patanjali Yoga Gram payment process, in this phase, it redirects to a page where it asks users to confirm the refund mode for online money transfer. Refer to Figure 3.\nFigure 3 Refund Type\nIn the next stage, the malware asks for banking information such as card details or net-banking credentials as per the users selection and uploads them to the server through URL: hxxps://srqc[.]online/controller/api/common/update.php as shown in Figures 4 & 5.\nFigure 4 Banking Information being requested\nFigure 5 Uploads the Banking Details to the Server\nAfter the user has provided card details such as card number, expiry date, and CVV, the malware also requests and uploads the PIN for these cards. Refer to Figures 6 & 7.\nFigure 6 Requests for PIN\nFigure 7 Uploads PIN to the Server\nAfter gaining access to these banking credentials, the malware drops an Android APK with the name Customer_Support from the server URL: hxxps://srqc[.]online/Customer_Support.apk, as shown in the below figure.\nFigure 8 Drops APK File\nThe malware also requests for the OTP sent by the banks to the users registered mobile number or email ID and sends it to the server, as shown in Figures 9 & 10.\nFigure 9 Requests for OTP\nFigure 10 Sends OTP to the Server"
