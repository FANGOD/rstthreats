                        "Understanding the threat landscape and how threats behave is the first step CrowdStrike researchers take toward strengthening customer protection. They based the following threat landscape analysis on internal and open source data, which revealed that in 2021 the most commonly encountered macOS malware types were ransomware (43%), backdoors (35%) and trojans (17%). Each category is powered by a different motive: ransomware by money, backdoors by remote access and trojans by data theft.",
                        "One of the most common methods of spreading malware involves using social engineering tactics in an attempt to trick the user into manually infecting their macOS. Fake updates, fake applications, trojanized applications and tainted versions of legitimate applications are the most common methods used to trick users into installing malicious software.",
                        "macOS malware also commonly uses debugger detection tactics, making analysis a challenge for researchers. Such tactics include using the sysctl API to check if the process is under debugging; calling the ptrace system call to prevent a debugger from attaching to the process; or even using built-in macOS commands to extract information about the machine.",
                        "Most malware, regardless of the targeted platform, make analysis difficult from the start by using anti-static analysis methods, such as string-based obfuscation or code obfuscation and encryption. Scripts usually use obfuscation tools that randomize function and variable names and insert junk and useless code, while binaries make use of packers or encryption.",
                        "Other malware variants, such as OSX.XCSSET, are distributed via either malicious documents or supply chain attacks targeting legitimate software development tools such as Xcode, Apples IDE. More complex attacks use exploits in different applications or in compromised OS kernels or accounts. For example, older OSX.FlashBack backdoor variants were known to use Java exploits to compromise targets.",
                        "Apple Disk Images (.dmg) are favored because theyre automatically mounted on execution; both OSX.EvilQuest (Figure 3) and OSX.Shlayer malware typically use this file type.<crlf>Packages (.pkg, .mpkg) are another common file type abused by malware as they allow malware developers to define preinstall and postinstall scripts that automatically run through the installation process. For example, OSX.EvilQuest uses a malicious package after mounting the .dmg file that has a postinstall script that copies the malicious OSX.EvilQuest binary to /Library/mixednkey/ under the name toolroomd.<crlf>AppleScripts or AppleScript variants like Run-only that are used for automating repetitive tasks are often abused by macOS threats such as OSX.OSAMiner, a popular cryptocurrency miner.",

The first one (is_debugging function starting at address 0000000100007AA0) is to check if the malware is debugged, and the second one (prevent_trace function starting at address 0000000100007C20) is to prevent debugging using a ptrace call with the flag PT_DENY_ATTACH.",

                        "Malware developers often try to hide or mask file types in an attempt to trick users into executing them. File-type identification also helps in establishing the tools required in the analysis. Figure 2 offers an overview of macOS malware file types.",
                        "macOS malware research starts with the fundamentals, such as classifying macOS malware by file type; continues with the capabilities, intended targets and general behavior of malware; and ends with obstacles researchers encounter when analyzing macOS malware.",

                        "Most threats, including macOS malware, attempt to ensure persistence to survive system reboots. Analyzing and understanding persistence tactics enables researchers to build behavior-based detections and train automated machine learning (ML) detections.",

OSX.EvilQuest performed this check by using a sleep function and calling the time function twice; the difference between the two time functions should return the time the malware used to sleep, yet because sandboxes usually patch sleep functions to quicken analysis, the differences between the two timestamps would be different and the malware would know it is running in a sandboxed environment.",
                        "Continuous research into the trends and behavior of macOS malware is turned into expert input and knowledge thats used to augment CrowdStrikes automated detection capabilities and build better protection for customers.",

This blog addresses some of the challenges and requirements our researchers must meet when analyzing macOS threats. The deep understanding and knowledge they gain is used both to create new features for structural parsing that augments our machine learning detection capabilities and to improve the proficiency of our behavior-based protection.",
                        "While one of the most common persistence mechanisms involves abusing Login Items in macOS, other popular persistence tactics include abusing Launch Items, adding malware to scheduled tasks, or using cronjobs to execute tasks sometime in the future.",
                        "The CrowdStrike Falcon platform protects macOS workloads using machine learning and behavior-based indicators of attack (IOAs) to defend macOS systems against malware and sophisticated threats, while delivering complete visibility and context into attacks.",
                        "For example, OSX.EvilQuest ransomware has been known to impersonate popular sound mixing applications (as seen in Figure 3), while trojans like OSX.Lador are distributed via spam emails that contain malicious add-ons, cracked applications, free programs and fake updates.",
                        "The hijacking of dylibs was once one of the stealthiest persistence mechanisms, especially in binaries. For example, some 2012 variants of the OSX.FlashBlack backdoor used malicious libraries injected at load time into a process via the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable (i.e., at load time the dynamic loader will examine the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES variable and load all specified libraries); others used the dylib hijacking technique of planting a malicious dylib for an application that tries to load dynamic libraries from multiple locations. However, Apple has long since improved security and reduced the number of use cases for abusing DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES.",
                        "Identifying the file type, understanding the behavior, targets and potential persistence mechanisms of possible threats, and knowing the possible obstacles an analyst may encounter in analyzing potential malware is crucial for building a solution that provides comprehensive protection and visibility against threats."

For example, older OSX.FlashBack backdoor variants were known to use Java exploits to compromise targets."

For example, some 2012 variants of the OSX.FlashBlack backdoor used malicious libraries injected at load time into a process via the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable (i.e., at load time the dynamic loader will examine the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES variable and load all specified libraries); others used the dylib hijacking technique of planting a malicious dylib for an application that tries to load dynamic libraries from multiple locations. However, Apple has long since improved security and reduced the number of use cases for abusing DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES."

For example, some 2012 variants of the OSX.FlashBlack backdoor used malicious libraries injected at load time into a process via the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable (i.e., at load time the dynamic loader will examine the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES variable and load all specified libraries); others used the dylib hijacking technique of planting a malicious dylib for an application that tries to load dynamic libraries from multiple locations. However, Apple has long since improved security and reduced the number of use cases for abusing DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES."
