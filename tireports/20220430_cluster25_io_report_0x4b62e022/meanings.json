                        "In this attack analyzed by C25, the Chinese APT used a spear phishing email to deliver a beacon of a Red Team framework known as Viper. The killchain includes an artifact that is already known and that was attributed to Naikon one year ago and it is used to load and execute a custom shellcode. The target of this attack is currently unknown but with high probability, given the previous history of the attack perpetrated by the group, it might be a government institution from a South Asian country.",
                        "The geolocalization and the sectors targeted by Naikon cyberattacks could likely suggest their intention to strategically attempt ASEAN members like Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Because of their more capitalist economic model, and their partnerships with the West, those countries could likely have important and classified foreign affairs or military information, which could likely be acquired and exploited by the Chinese threat actor. In fact, the group focused its previous attacks on high profile targets such as government agencies and military organizations in the South Asian region. Most government bodies targeted by Naikon APT cybercriminals are usually in the foreign affairs or science and technology sectors. Some state-owned businesses and companies have also reportedly been targeted by the threat actor.",
                        "NAIKON is the name of an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) which is believed to originate from China. The Naikon hacker group was first tracked over a decade ago, back in 2010. Naikon APT hit the headlines in 2015 when malware researchers discovered the infrastructure used by cybercriminals. Thanks to this, one of the members of the hacker group was caught by law enforcement. After this oversight, cybersecurity analysts suggested that Naikon APT went out of business. However, Naikon has resurfaced in the last weeks.",
                        "By observing Naikon APTs hacking arsenal, it was concluded that this group tends to conduct long-term intelligence and espionage operations, typical for a group that aims to conduct attacks on foreign governments and officials. To avoid detection and maximize the result, it changed different TTPs and tools over time.",
                        "During the analysis it was discovered part of Naikon APT arsenal. Starting from what we observed we can assert that this Chinese group is using open-source tools like Viper and ARL (Asset Reconnaissance Lighthouse). Both tools seem to be developed by a Chinese programmer, as most of their documentation is written in Mandarin.",
