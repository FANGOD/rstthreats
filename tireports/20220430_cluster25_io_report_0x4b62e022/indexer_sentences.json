Thanks to this, one of the members of the hacker group was caught by law enforcement. After this oversight, cybersecurity analysts suggested that Naikon APT went out of business. However, Naikon has resurfaced in the last weeks."}

Because of their more capitalist economic model, and their partnerships with the West, those countries could likely have important and classified foreign affairs or military information, which could likely be acquired and exploited by the Chinese threat actor. In fact, the group focused its previous attacks on high profile targets such as government agencies and military organizations in the South Asian region. Most government bodies targeted by Naikon APT cybercriminals are usually in the foreign affairs or science and technology sectors. Some state-owned businesses and companies have also reportedly been targeted by the threat actor."}
