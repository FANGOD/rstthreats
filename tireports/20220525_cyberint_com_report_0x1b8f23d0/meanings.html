One of the difficulties of a new group is, of course, publicity. It seems that the group took the initiative to promote themselves in the Lapsus$ gangs dying Telegram channel (Figure 7), talking about their exploits and publishing their blog.</li>

                                        <li>RansomHouse has two basic and popular communication channels: Telegram and Onion.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Because they have established the fact that organizations not protecting themselves with state-of-the-art technologies are the bad guys in our story, RansomHouse introduces themselves as the public messengers and target any organization that is not protecting itself properly or does not reward and respect bug bounty programs.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>RansomHouse is another new creature emerging within this reality. A group of talented red and blue teamers that has two faces the pro-freedom, liberal and anti-radicalism, and the face of a group that is terrorizing organizations and forcing them to pay or be shamed.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Figure 3: RansomHouse opens a Telegram channel for journalists</li>
                                    
                                        <li>As the new group tries to compromise as many organizations as possible, they also try to draw a picture, to both for victims and the general community, that they are an honest group that, once paid, will help the organization protect itself from future attacks and will provide a full report on how and what vulnerabilities were exploited in the process. They also promise to delete any information they stole, along with any evidence of the compromised organization even being on their victims list. Lastly, RansomHouse claims that they will also delete any backdoors they currently have on the victims network (Figure 6).</li>
                                    
                                        <li>According to RansomHouse, many businesses and companies are not willing to invest as much money as required to fortify their infrastructures, while they ignore or do not institute enough bug bounty plans. Bug bounty are programs that encourage individuals to search for bugs and vulnerabilities in the organizations infrastructure and report them, and in return, the individual is rewarded with a payment. The group claims that these organizations put their assets and, most importantly, their customers information at risk.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Throughout their entire introduction process, RansomHouse sees themselves as the ones who do whats right and makes excuses such as the organizations are the ones to lead us to these actions as they are avoiding taking any responsibility.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>RansomHouse to the Rescue</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Figure 7: RansomHouse announcement of a new victim in Lapsus$ Telegram channel found in Argos Edge</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Ironically, RansomHouse announced on their Onion site that they are pro-freedom and support the free market, but on the other hand, they punish organizations that choose to not invest in their protection systems.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>RansomHouse is one of the groups that has adopted this type of technique, as they are claiming that they do not use any encryption in their campaigns.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Overall, RansomHouse tries to introduce itself as a group that is trying to create a better future for the cybersecurity world as they force their bug bounty programs on organizations.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>At some point, it seems that the channels admins did not approve of these actions and muted the RansomHouse account.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>RansomHouse is practically forcing penetration testing services on organizations that never used their services or rewarded bug bounties, and once they find any vulnerabilities, they fully exploit them to steal as much sensitive data as possible.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>RansomHouse campaigns focus on data exfiltration only; they do not possess or develop any encryption modules. In their words: nothing to do with breaches and dont produce or use any ransomware.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Figure 5: RansomHouse recruiting announcement</li>
                                    
                                        <li>RansomHouse truly respects journalists and promotes themselves as a great partner to work with as they have opened a new Telegram channel dedicated to journalists only (Figure 3).</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Figure 1: RansomHouse homepage</li>

                                        <li>Over the past weeks, a new and slightly odd ransomware group has emerged named RansomHouse. At glance, it looks like any other ransomware group, but claims to be something other than what we are used to seeing.</li>

One of the difficulties of a new group is, of course, publicity.
