They also promise to delete any information they stole, along with any evidence of the compromised organization even being on their victims list. Lastly, RansomHouse claims that they will also delete any backdoors they currently have on the victims network (Figure 6).",
                        "According to RansomHouse, many businesses and companies are not willing to invest as much money as required to fortify their infrastructures, while they ignore or do not institute enough bug bounty plans. Bug bounty are programs that encourage individuals to search for bugs and vulnerabilities in the organizations infrastructure and report them, and in return, the individual is rewarded with a payment. The group claims that these organizations put their assets and, most importantly, their customers information at risk.",

                        "RansomHouse is one of the groups that has adopted this type of technique, as they are claiming that they do not use any encryption in their campaigns.",
