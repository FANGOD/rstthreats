The attacker published ~800 packages, most of them having a unique user account per package, in bursts over the span of roughly a week. While the packages names were methodically picked, the names of the users publishing them were randomly generated strings such as 5t7crz72 and d4ugwerp. This is uncommon for the automated attacks we see. Usually, attackers create a single user and burst their attacks over it. From this behavior, we can conclude that the attacker built an automation process from end to end, including registering users and passing the OTP challenges.",

One of the downsides of this is the fact that once one of the malicious packages is detected it is likely that all of the other packages under this user account will be detected as part of an investigation and will be taken down as well. This new technique (user account per package) goes into some effort to avoid a situation where the package is taken down for as long as possible.",

The 3 reports are all related to the same threat actor.",

This means that if our attacker ran their server in that manner, we would be able to connect to it and possibly gain access to interesting information.

Since our server is hosted on AWS, and is assigned with a private IP address, we had to configure it with the public IP -ip. The domain flag -domain was also needed to instruct the server what name needed to issue an SSL certificate for. In addition, we wanted to add a token-based authentication between the client and the server, so we defined a token string as we ran the server. While experimenting the connectivity with the client, we saw the default client id was quite long, so changing the -cidl and -cidn flags made it possible to shorten the client id.
