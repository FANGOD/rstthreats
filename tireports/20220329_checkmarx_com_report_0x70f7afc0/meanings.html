                                        <li>Checkmarx Supply Chain Security (SCS) team has uncovered hundreds of malicious packages attempting to use a dependency confusion attack. Customarily, attackers use an anonymous disposable NPM account from which they launch their attacks. As it seems this time, the attacker has fully-automated the process of NPM account creation and has open dedicated accounts, one per package, making his new malicious packages batch harder to spot.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Home A Beautiful Factory for Malicious Packages</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The initial curiosity toward this cluster of malicious packages was in light of the scale and frequency of the attacks. The attacker published ~800 packages, most of them having a unique user account per package, in bursts over the span of roughly a week. While the packages names were methodically picked, the names of the users publishing them were randomly generated strings such as 5t7crz72 and d4ugwerp. This is uncommon for the automated attacks we see. Usually, attackers create a single user and burst their attacks over it. From this behavior, we can conclude that the attacker built an automation process from end to end, including registering users and passing the OTP challenges.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Now that we have our brand-new user account on NPM, we can continue to create and publish our malicious package, all automatically of course. Adhering to what the attacker seems to do.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Customarily, an attacker would open an anonymous NPM account and publish all or most of their packages under this user account. One of the downsides of this is the fact that once one of the malicious packages is detected it is likely that all of the other packages under this user account will be detected as part of an investigation and will be taken down as well. This new technique (user account per package) goes into some effort to avoid a situation where the package is taken down for as long as possible.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>About 3 weeks ago we reported in Checkmarx blogpost of an attacker experimenting in several techniques while attempting dependency confusion attacks. In the past week, research teams from JFrog and Sonatype have also published blog posts informing the community about hundreds of malicious packages. The 3 reports are all related to the same threat actor.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>In total, Checkmarx SCS team has detected ~800 malicious packages published by RED-LILI. The packages were all disclosed to the NPM and PyPi security teams as well as to the service provider hosting the attacker infrastructure Multacom.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>We presume that this is the way attackers who publish bursts of malicious packages were able to automate their process without setting up the described mechanism.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>At the time of writing, the threat actors RED-LILI is still active at the time of writing and continues to publish malicious packages. So far, the packages listed in this report were detected by Checkmarxs internal systems and disclosed to NPM.</li>

During this time, and until today, the team studied this attack actors capabilities and techniques, while continuously disclosing the findings to NPM security team.</li>

                                        <li>Checkmarx Supply Chain Security (SCS) team has uncovered hundreds of malicious packages attempting to use a dependency confusion attack. Customarily, attackers use an anonymous disposable NPM account from which they launch their attacks. As it seems this time, the attacker has fully-automated the process of NPM account creation and has open dedicated accounts, one per package, making his new malicious packages batch harder to spot.</li>

                                        <li>About 3 weeks ago we reported in Checkmarx blogpost of an attacker experimenting in several techniques while attempting dependency confusion attacks. In the past week, research teams from JFrog and Sonatype have also published blog posts informing the community about hundreds of malicious packages. The 3 reports are all related to the same threat actor.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>In total, Checkmarx SCS team has detected ~800 malicious packages published by RED-LILI. The packages were all disclosed to the NPM and PyPi security teams as well as to the service provider hosting the attacker infrastructure Multacom.</li>

                                        <li>The configuration of Interactsh server is straight forward. Since our server is hosted on AWS, and is assigned with a private IP address, we had to configure it with the public IP -ip. The domain flag -domain was also needed to instruct the server what name needed to issue an SSL certificate for. In addition, we wanted to add a token-based authentication between the client and the server, so we defined a token string as we ran the server. While experimenting the connectivity with the client, we saw the default client id was quite long, so changing the -cidl and -cidn flags made it possible to shorten the client id. Note that this needs to match in both server and client, otherwise the data will not be synchronized properly.</li>

                                        <li>The initial curiosity toward this cluster of malicious packages was in light of the scale and frequency of the attacks. The attacker published ~800 packages, most of them having a unique user account per package, in bursts over the span of roughly a week. While the packages names were methodically picked, the names of the users publishing them were randomly generated strings such as 5t7crz72 and d4ugwerp. This is uncommon for the automated attacks we see. Usually, attackers create a single user and burst their attacks over it. From this behavior, we can conclude that the attacker built an automation process from end to end, including registering users and passing the OTP challenges.</li>

                                        <li>Customarily, an attacker would open an anonymous NPM account and publish all or most of their packages under this user account. One of the downsides of this is the fact that once one of the malicious packages is detected it is likely that all of the other packages under this user account will be detected as part of an investigation and will be taken down as well. This new technique (user account per package) goes into some effort to avoid a situation where the package is taken down for as long as possible.</li>

                                        <li>The next building block was to configure the Interactsh client with proper communication to the server to conclude the infrastructure phase. But before we go on to that, there is one more interesting detail that lies in this server-client connection.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>If not specified when running Interactsh server, it will allow connections from clients with no validation. This means that if our attacker ran their server in that manner, we would be able to connect to it and possibly gain access to interesting information. This hope had quickly faded since the attacker seems to use the -a or -t flags in the server run command, which means that access to it will be granted only to the client providing the correct authentication token.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>During this function, a hidden browser is launched using Selenium and the matching ChromeDriver. After interacting with the form fields, NPM servers sends the OTP email via SMTP protocol to the users email address, resulting in the users email address being sent to my Interactsh server (e.g. c90ehc8ngyaer@c90ehc8ngyaer.malpkg.site). This data can be queried using the wrapped InteractshClient mentioned above like so:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The configuration of Interactsh server is straight forward. Since our server is hosted on AWS, and is assigned with a private IP address, we had to configure it with the public IP -ip. The domain flag -domain was also needed to instruct the server what name needed to issue an SSL certificate for. In addition, we wanted to add a token-based authentication between the client and the server, so we defined a token string as we ran the server. While experimenting the connectivity with the client, we saw the default client id was quite long, so changing the -cidl and -cidn flags made it possible to shorten the client id. Note that this needs to match in both server and client, otherwise the data will not be synchronized properly.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The real magic is harnessing Interactsh as a building block with automation. I have written an internal tool in Python for research purposes, simulating the steps done the attack group. Partial code snippets from this tool are referenced below.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>As mentioned above, Interactsh is an open-source project written in Go. It has a client application and a server application. The former can be installed from its source code using go install command or by downloading a matching precompiled version from the projects releases page.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Setting up the domains DNS records was quite straight forward as documents in Interactsh official documentation. In addition to the regular A record, we also configured the NS record to support the DNS tunneling functionality for data exfiltration.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Once we got all the configurations in order, we had our own interactsh server linked to our new domain.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Interactsh is an open-source tool for out-of-band Data Extraction, and is a tool originally designed to detect bugs that cause external interactions. The usage is quite simple, running Interactsh gives the operator a unique URL, which whenever interacted with it, audits the full details to the operator for later inspection. Interactsh supports multiple network protocols, including HTTP, SMTP, DNS, and more.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Interactsh can be used as-is. Zero configuration is needed for inexperienced users via the web application app.interactsh.com. And for the more advanced users, Interactsh is built to run self-hosted on a dedicated server which its operator has the option to customize advanced settings including supporting a custom domain</li>

In addition, we wanted to add a token-based authentication between the client and the server, so we defined a token string as we ran the server. While experimenting the connectivity with the client, we saw the default client id was quite long, so changing the -cidl and -cidn flags made it possible to shorten the client id.

After interacting with the form fields, NPM servers sends the OTP email via SMTP protocol to the users email address, resulting in the users email address being sent to my Interactsh server (e.g. c90ehc8ngyaer@c90ehc8ngyaer.malpkg.site). This data can be queried using the wrapped InteractshClient mentioned above like so:</li>

This could be done by generating an Access Token in the settings page having the 2FA requirement disabled.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>To deal with bots and verify the validity of the email address, NPM added a challenge to the user with an OTP sent to the email address as the last step of the registration process.</li>

Since the same OTP email is sent, we can use the same function that parses the OTP from interactsh-server incoming email. The function looks like so:</li>
