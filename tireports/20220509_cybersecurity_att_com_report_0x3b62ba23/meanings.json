The Command and Control (C&C) tactic, as identified by the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, consists of techniques that adversaries may use to communicate with systems under their control within a victim network. Cobalt Strike is an effective adversary simulation tool used in security assessments but has been abused by malicious actors for Command and Control of victim networks. If configured by attackers, it can be used to deploy malicious software, execute scripts, and more.",

This threat was remediated by isolating the asset and scanning it with SentinelOne to remove indicators of compromise.
