                        "Meterpreter a trojan-type program enables attackers to take control of affected machines remotely. This malware injects itself into compromised processes rather than creating new ones. Meterpreter can transmit and receive files, launch executable files, perform command shell operations, capture screenshots, and record keystrokes. The main objective of its distribution is either to generate revenue or infect devices with additional malware. Infected email attachments, malicious online advertisements, social engineering are some of its distribution methods. Cyber thieves can infect victims systems with more malware, such as ransomware, by sending, receiving, and executing files using Meterpreter. Ransomware encrypts data, making it impossible for victims to use or access it unless they acquire decryption tools from the programs creators. Identity theft, banking information, and passwords theft are the main impact of this trojan"
