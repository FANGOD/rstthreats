On May 12, the countrys president declared a state of national emergency. Days later, he announced that the country is at war; a war against a cybercrime group Conti. This took place after the Conti group breached and encrypted at least 27 of Costa Ricas governmental agencies. Moreover, while the government decided not to pay the ransom, the group declared its goal to overthrow the government of Costa Rica and called for its citizens to go to the streets and change the government. This probably started as a regular ransomware attack, but it quickly turned into a new type of event with significant financial and geopolitical consequences. In this case, both Conti and Costa Rica brought the US to the stage, which perfectly fits the groups pro Russian agenda. Even if all those events are just a smoke screen for rebuilding Contis operations, the group has already made a mark that country extortion is possible, and a cybercrime group can be a player in a geopolitical area."}

The Conti ransomware group is well known for bringing double and triple extortion tactics against its victims to a state of near perfection. Check Points latest research showed that Conti is more than just a cybercrime group, but an organized, hierarchical and structured tech company. While some ransomware groups reduced their activity due to the Ukraine Russia war and the western sanctions on Russia, we saw an opposite phenomenon from the Conti group. Despite the major leak Conti suffered at the end of February, we see that during the months of March April 2022 Conti had significantly increased the number of its victims compared to January February; probably as a smoke screen to its reorganization efforts."}

Automated, protected data backups enable an organization to recover from an attack with minimum data loss and without paying a ransom. Maintaining regular backups of data as a routine process is a very important practice to prevent losing data, as well as to be able to recover it in the event of corruption or disk hardware malfunction. Patching: Patching is a critical component in defending against ransomware attacks as cyber-criminals will often look for the latest uncovered exploits in the patches made available and then target systems that are not yet patched. As such, it is critical for organizations to ensure that all systems have the latest patches applied to them, as this reduces the number of potential vulnerabilities within the business for an attacker to exploit. User Authentication: Accessing services like RDP with stolen user credentials is a favorite technique of ransomware attackers. The use of strong user authentication can make it harder for an attacker to make use of a guessed or stolen password Reduce the Attack Surface: With the high potential cost of a ransomware infection, prevention is the best ransomware mitigation strategy. This can be achieved by reducing the attack surface by addressing:"}

Anti-ransomware solutions are built to identify those fingerprints. Common characteristics of a good anti-ransomware solution include: Wide variant detection Fast detection Automatic restoration Restoration mechanism not based on common built-in tools (like Shadow Copy, which is targeted by some ransomware variants) Cyber Awareness Training and Education:Ransomware is often spread using phishing emails. Training users on how to identify and avoid potential ransomware attacks is crucial. As many of the current cyber-attacks start with a targeted email that does not even contain malware, but only a socially engineered message that encourages the user to click on a malicious link, user education is often considered as one of the most important defenses an organization can deploy."}

In these cases, Conti showed not only the power of the technological means (e.g., malware, ransomware, etc.) that they are using, but also the power of information warfare means being implemented by a cybercrime group. Whatever their real reason behind the attacks on Costa Rica and Peru might be, they definitely opened a new chapter in the ransomware eco system."}
