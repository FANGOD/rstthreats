                        "Peru is another victim of country extortion by Conti. The public stage of the extortion attack against Peru started on May 7, and currently focuses on two key government entities Ministry of Finance and General Intelligence Directorate.",
                        "In this blog post, Check Point Research (CPR) looks into Contis increased activity since the start of the Ukraine- Russia war, which came to its peak with country extortion against the governments of Costa Rica and Peru.",
                        "3.April 21st Conti publishes the database of the Costa Rican Ministry of Finance",
                        "An unprecedented event has occurred in Costa Rica. On May 12, the countrys president declared a state of national emergency. Days later, he announced that the country is at war; a war against a cybercrime group Conti. This took place after the Conti group breached and encrypted at least 27 of Costa Ricas governmental agencies. Moreover, while the government decided not to pay the ransom, the group declared its goal to overthrow the government of Costa Rica and called for its citizens to go to the streets and change the government.<crlf>This probably started as a regular ransomware attack, but it quickly turned into a new type of event with significant financial and geopolitical consequences. In this case, both Conti and Costa Rica brought the US to the stage, which perfectly fits the groups pro Russian agenda.<crlf>Even if all those events are just a smoke screen for rebuilding Contis operations, the group has already made a mark that country extortion is possible, and a cybercrime group can be a player in a geopolitical area.",
                        "The following is the full chain of the posts by Conti about the attack:",
                        "11. May 19th Conti escalates its rhetoric against the US",

                        "8.May 14th Conti exercised a triple extortion strategy, where it asked the citizens of Costa Rica to demonstrate against their government so they would pay, and suggested replacing the government.",
                        "In the last month, Conti not only expanded the number of its victims, but also extended the type of victims. In a bold move, the group decided to attack and extort entire countries.<crlf>In the past, ransomware groups have attacked different governmental entities around the world, those were mostly specific, tactical attacks on municipal level entities and not wide attacks on critical governmental services.<crlf>Conti is conducting a wide extortion operation against two governments in Latin America Costa Rica and Peru. Both incidents are developing attacks that started with a small compromise of one agency in each country, and quickly expanded to country wide extortions.",
                        "This quickly escalating cyber event has evolved into a wide geopolitical event. It happened when on the one hand, Costa Rica asked for support from the US and the US state department then offered a $10,000,000 reward for information on Contis leaders. On the other hand, the rhetoric of the Conti group around the Costa Rican extortion started to involve the US and President Biden, and not just Costa Ricans.",

                        "Moreover, those attacks went beyond the scope of a purely financially motivated attack, and have now become geopolitical events. The Costa Rican government declaring a national emergency and stating they are at war with Conti, has led the US government to intervene in the situation and support Costa Rica. This is an unprecedented situation when a country declares they are at war with a cybercriminal group.",

                        "Since the groups emergence in 2020, Conti has taken the place as a leader of the underground ransomware market and is known as one of the most prolific and innovative groups out there. They have accumulated more than 800 victims, mostly large companies and corporations with millions of dollars in revenue. The Conti ransomware group is well known for bringing double and triple extortion tactics against its victims to a state of near perfection.<crlf>Check Points latest research showed that Conti is more than just a cybercrime group, but an organized, hierarchical and structured tech company.<crlf>While some ransomware groups reduced their activity due to the Ukraine Russia war and the western sanctions on Russia, we saw an opposite phenomenon from the Conti group. Despite the major leak Conti suffered at the end of February, we see that during the months of March April 2022 Conti had significantly increased the number of its victims compared to January February; probably as a smoke screen to its reorganization efforts.",

                        "The two attacks by Conti on sovereign countries and the rhetoric they use, depict the growing power of organized cybercrime groups. In these cases, Conti showed not only the power of the technological means (e.g., malware, ransomware, etc.) that they are using, but also the power of information warfare means being implemented by a cybercrime group. Whatever their real reason behind the attacks on Costa Rica and Peru might be, they definitely opened a new chapter in the ransomware eco system.",
                        "Analysis of some of Contis posts on the shame website regarding the attack on Costa Rica depicts an unprecedented rhetoric of a cybercrime group against countries and governments. It started with Costa Rica but continued to even harsher and ruder language towards the US and President Biden."

Common characteristics of a good anti-ransomware solution include: Wide variant detection Fast detection Automatic restoration Restoration mechanism not based on common built-in tools (like Shadow Copy, which is targeted by some ransomware variants)<crlf>Cyber Awareness Training and Education:Ransomware is often spread using phishing emails. Training users on how to identify and avoid potential ransomware attacks is crucial. As many of the current cyber-attacks start with a targeted email that does not even contain malware, but only a socially engineered message that encourages the user to click on a malicious link, user education is often considered as one of the most important defenses an organization can deploy.",

                        "Continuous data backups: The definition of ransomware is explained as malware designed to force a ransom payment as the only way to restore access to the encrypted data. Automated, protected data backups enable an organization to recover from an attack with minimum data loss and without paying a ransom. Maintaining regular backups of data as a routine process is a very important practice to prevent losing data, as well as to be able to recover it in the event of corruption or disk hardware malfunction.<crlf>Patching: Patching is a critical component in defending against ransomware attacks as cyber-criminals will often look for the latest uncovered exploits in the patches made available and then target systems that are not yet patched. As such, it is critical for organizations to ensure that all systems have the latest patches applied to them, as this reduces the number of potential vulnerabilities within the business for an attacker to exploit.<crlf>User Authentication: Accessing services like RDP with stolen user credentials is a favorite technique of ransomware attackers.

Days later, he announced that the country is at war; a war against a cybercrime group Conti. This took place after the Conti group breached and encrypted at least 27 of Costa Ricas governmental agencies. Moreover, while the government decided not to pay the ransom, the group declared its goal to overthrow the government of Costa Rica and called for its citizens to go to the streets and change the government.<crlf>This probably started as a regular ransomware attack, but it quickly turned into a new type of event with significant financial and geopolitical consequences. In this case, both Conti and Costa Rica brought the US to the stage, which perfectly fits the groups pro Russian agenda.<crlf>Even if all those events are just a smoke screen for rebuilding Contis operations, the group has already made a mark that country extortion is possible, and a cybercrime group can be a player in a geopolitical area.",

Automated, protected data backups enable an organization to recover from an attack with minimum data loss and without paying a ransom. Maintaining regular backups of data as a routine process is a very important practice to prevent losing data, as well as to be able to recover it in the event of corruption or disk hardware malfunction.<crlf>Patching: Patching is a critical component in defending against ransomware attacks as cyber-criminals will often look for the latest uncovered exploits in the patches made available and then target systems that are not yet patched. As such, it is critical for organizations to ensure that all systems have the latest patches applied to them, as this reduces the number of potential vulnerabilities within the business for an attacker to exploit.<crlf>User Authentication: Accessing services like RDP with stolen user credentials is a favorite technique of ransomware attackers. The use of strong user authentication can make it harder for an attacker to make use of a guessed or stolen password<crlf>Reduce the Attack Surface: With the high potential cost of a ransomware infection, prevention is the best ransomware mitigation strategy.

Anti-ransomware solutions are built to identify those fingerprints. Common characteristics of a good anti-ransomware solution include: Wide variant detection Fast detection Automatic restoration Restoration mechanism not based on common built-in tools (like Shadow Copy, which is targeted by some ransomware variants)<crlf>Cyber Awareness Training and Education:Ransomware is often spread using phishing emails. Training users on how to identify and avoid potential ransomware attacks is crucial. As many of the current cyber-attacks start with a targeted email that does not even contain malware, but only a socially engineered message that encourages the user to click on a malicious link, user education is often considered as one of the most important defenses an organization can deploy."
