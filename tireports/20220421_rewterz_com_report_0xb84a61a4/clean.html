<h2>Analysis Summary</h2>
<p>QBot, often known as QakBot, is modular information malware. It has been operational since 2007. This banking Trojan, QakBot steals financial data from infected systems, and a loader using C2 servers for payload targeting and download. Qakbot has worm capabilities, which let it propagate to other computers on the same network, as well as rootkit capabilities, which allow it to mask its existence and build persistence on infected computers.</p>
<p>A malware attachment to a phishing email is commonly used in QakBot attacks. This particular campaign includes an xls file that contains macros. These macros run a script that fetches the Qakbot payload from a list of URLs. To get the victim to activate macros, the attackers employ a common trick, like when the target downloads the file, it is asked to allow changes and then content before viewing the document.</p>
