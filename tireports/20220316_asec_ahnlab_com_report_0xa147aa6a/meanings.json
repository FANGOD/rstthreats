                        "As its name suggests, Gh0stCringe RAT is a RAT malware that connects to the C&C server and performs various malicious behaviors by receiving commands from the attacker. The attacker can designate various settings to Gh0stCringe just like other RAT malware. The explanations in this blog are based on the analyzed sample.",
                        "Gh0stCringe RAT that is recently being discovered is being distributed to vulnerable database servers. Gh0stCringe-related logs in AhnLabs ASD show that logs were not only created by the sqlservr.exe process (MS-SQL server) but also by the MySQL server process for Windows environment (see figure below).",
                        "Considering the fact that MySQL servers are targets of attack in addition to MS-SQL servers, it can be assumed that Gh0stCringe targets poorly-managed DB servers with vulnerable account credentials.",
                        "Gh0stCringe, also known as CirenegRAT, is one of the malware variants based on the code of Gh0st RAT. It was first discovered in December 2018, and it is known to have been distributed via SMB vulnerability (using the SMB vulnerability tool of ZombieBoy).[2] Since then, no direct relationship has been found, but it was mentioned in the KingMiner CoinMiner analysis report[3] published in June 2020.",
                        "Mode #0: If the Rsuyke mkgcgkuc service does not exist, the malware creates the service but does not register it in a proper way. If the self-copy setting is turned on, the malware copies itself to the path %ProgramFiles% with a random name. As the created service is not registered in a proper way and the malware does not use additional techniques such as Run Key registration, persistence is not maintained.<crlf>Mode #1: Just like in Mode #0, the malware creates an abnormal Rsuyke mkgcgkuc service. It registers the service to HKLM Run Key, enabling it to maintain persistence.<crlf>Mode #2: The malware copies itself to the path %ProgramFiles%\\Cccogae.exe and registers to Rsuyke mkgcgkuc service. When it executes the service, it gives Win7 as the argument and executes Gh0stCringe. As the service is registered in a proper way, persistence is maintained. Additionally, if the self-copy settings is turned on, it copies itself to the path %SystemDirectory%[Random].bak.<crlf>Mode Windows 10: It registers to HKCU Run Key, enabling it to maintain persistence.",
                        "Gh0stCringe was created based on the source code of publicly released Gh0st RAT. The following is a comparison between the CFileManager::OpenFile() function of Gh0st RAT that was publicly released and the function of Gh0stCringe. It shows that a part of the source code was used without modifications. Note that unlike normal variants where the majority of their codes is similar to the original code based on the Gh0st RAT source code, the majority of Gh0stCringe codes is unique just like how Gh0stCringe has its own name.",

In addition to them, the malware is executed in an exclusive mode in Windows 10 version. All modes ultimately communicate with the C&C server and perform commands, but there are differences in their features related to maintaining persistence.",

The information of the infected system listed above was a 0x22C size, and additional data of a 0xF size was added in the front. The xy string (first 3 bytes 0x787920) is the signature string of Gh0stCringe."
