                        "Like many modern malware variants, getting ZLoader onto a device is oftentimes just the first step in what ends up being a larger attack. The trojan further exemplifies the trend of common malware increasingly harboring more dangerous threats, a pattern also observed in other platforms. ZLoader operators frequently monetize access from infections by selling it to other affiliate groups, who then use the purchased access to carry out their own malicious objectives. Affiliates may further misuse legitimate tools like Cobalt Strike or Splashtop to gain full hands-on-keyboard access to target devices, enabling attackers to perform additional discovery, find high-value targets on the network, move laterally, and drop additional payloads, such as ransomware variants.",
                        "ZLoader is a malware variant that has evolved over the years and is used for multiple objectives, meaning that two campaigns which both use ZLoader may appear completely different. For example, an individual who has experience responding to a ZLoader campaign that originated from email and dropped the payload via a malicious Office macro, may be shocked at the complexity of a second ZLoader campaign that uses numerous malicious files for reconnaissance and antivirus tampering, before finally dropping the actual malware payload.",
                        "In this blog post, we characterize the various methods by which a ZLoader campaign might be identified, along with detailing detection and mitigation information that can help users reduce the impact of this threat.",
                        "ZLoaders prevalence in the threat landscape demands comprehensive protection capable of detecting and stopping this malware, its components, and other similar threats at every stage of the attack chain. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provides next-generation protection that reinforces network security perimeters and incorporates antimalware capabilities to catch emerging threats, including ZLoader, Cobalt Strike, additional payloads such as ransomware, and subsequent attacker behaviors. Moreover, our endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities detect ZLoaders malicious files, behaviors, domain connections, and other related events before and after execution.",
                        "As announced today, Microsoft took action against the ZLoader trojan by working with telecommunications providers around the world to disrupt key ZLoader infrastructure. We used our research into this threat to enrich our protection technologies and ensure this infrastructure could no longer be leveraged by operators to distribute the trojan or activate deployed payloads like ransomware. Moreover, we are sharing this intelligence to emphasize the importance of collaboration throughout the larger security community. Below, we will detail the various aspects for identifying a ZLoader campaign.",
                        "In more recent campaigns, ZLoader has shifted away from using email as a means of delivery and instead used malicious ads on search engines such as Google to trick users into visiting malicious sites.",
                        "ZLoader alert activity",
                        "Signals from Microsoft Defender for Office 365 inform Microsoft 365 Defender, which correlates cross-domain threat intelligence to deliver coordinated defense, that ZLoader has been detected when a document is delivered via email when detonation is enabled. These alerts, however, can also be triggered by unrelated threat activity.",
                        "ZLoader has used various persistence methods across separate campaigns. The first method observed by Microsoft Security Researchers involves the ZLoader DLL usingrundll32.exeto register itself. In other documented cases, it also creates the following persistence mechanisms for itself or its modules:",
                        "ZLoader malware has been observed being delivered in multiple ways. Two of the most prominent methods include malicious search engine ads and malicious emails.",
                        "In some campaigns, the attackers used a script to run various discovery commands prior to downloading the ZLoader payload, including:",
                        "In general, a connection was made to a compromised WordPress instance hosting the PHP code used by the ZLoader kit. At this stage, the ZLoader payload was downloaded as a DLL masquerading as an HTML file that is then launched usingrundll32.exe.",
                        "ZLoader has used various methods of defense evasion, focused on attempting to appear more legitimate or by disabling security tools. In multiple campaigns associated with malicious ads, the ZLoader operators would sign malicious files used in their attack chain. Signing these files is intended to make them appear to be legitimate, non-malicious files used by real software, rather than malicious files used by malware.",
                        "One of the main functionalities of ZLoader malware is to steal online credentials targeting banks and financial institutions, as well as other credentials, via client-side web injection and form grabbing attacks. Web injection allows the attacker to alter content of the websites displayed to the victim, while form grabbing captures credentials from the browser windows. To accomplish those actions, the malware implements an Adversary-in-the-browser (AiTB) attack.",
                        "Surface devices with ZLoader alerts and related malicious activity.",
                        "The take down effort against ZLoader is just one of the ways in which Microsoft provides real-world protection against threats. This action will result in protection for a wide range of organizations around the world from malware, affiliates with hands-on-keyboard access, and additional payloads delivered via ZLoaders infrastructure.",
                        "ZLoader attacks have affected nations around the world, with the majority targeting the US, China, western Europe, and Japan. Due to the modular nature of some of ZLoaders capabilities and its constant shifts in techniques, different ZLoader campaigns may look nothing alike. Previous campaigns have been fairly simple, with the malware delivered via malicious Office macros attached to emails and then used to deploy modules for capabilities. Other, more recent campaigns are notably complexinjecting malicious code into legitimate processes, disabling antivirus solutions, and ultimately culminating in ransomware.",
                        "As with many other malware variants, prior ZLoader campaigns have also been known to use malicious emails to deliver Office documents containing malicious macros that download the payload. The ZLoader operators do not have a preferred method of delivering these Office documents and have been observed using both links and attachments in various campaigns. Some observed means by which a ZLoader email was associated with a malicious document include:",

Weve also seen ZLoader operators provide access to ELBRUS actors who deployed DarkSide ransomware (earlier in 2021). Those that were more recently observed had been deploying BlackMatter ransomware. Given such history, the Cobalt Strike payloads might indicate pre-ransomware activities that prefigure a real threat of ransomware attacks.",
                        "The best advice for preventing ZLoader infections is to simply avoid downloading attachments contained in emails from unknown senders as well as clicking on sponsored ads and links in search engine results, instead opting for unsponsored results from verified, trusted sources. Good credential hygiene, network segmentation, and similar best practices increase the cost to attackers, helping disrupt their activities before they reach their target.",

                        "ZLoader operators have also updated their methodology to frequently deliver the malware through targeted malicious Google Ads. The use of ad fraud is a stealthy way to target end users as it bypasses typical security solutions that can be found in email and surfaces itself in normal browser activities instead.",

                        "The first method ZLoader has used to sign files is by creating fictitious companies. In certain campaigns, the .msi files that are installed on the device after the user visits a malicious ad are signed by a fictitious company created by the operator for the purpose of the campaign. The malware operators created multiple fraudulent companies, such as Flyintellect Inc, and Datalyst Oy, in several campaigns. Due to the way .msi files are designed, the registry keys that are added by this activity later in the attack chain are also published by the same company name.",
                        "The codes injected will insert fake web controls and/or additional JavaScript codes that are responsible for capturing the credentials such as usernames, passwords, and others. This captured information is encrypted and sent to the main bot and then to the C2 server. With these stolen credentials, the ZLoader operators can potentially gain access to users Microsoft online account to perform further illicit activities. As the malicious activities occurred in the background, even tech savvy users may not be aware that their browser was tampered with, and credentials were stolen.",

                        "Derived from the Zeus banking trojan first discovered in 2007, ZLoader is a malware family notable for its ability to evolve and change from campaign to campaign, having undergone much development since its inception. ZLoader has remained relevant as attackers tool of choice by including defense evasion capabilities, like disabling security and antivirus tools, and selling access-as-a-service to other affiliate groups, such as ransomware operators. Its capabilities include capturing screenshots, collecting cookies, stealing credentials and banking data, performing reconnaissance, launching persistence mechanisms, misusing legitimate security tools, and providing remote access to attackers.",

Enabling cloud protection and automatic sample submission for Microsoft Defender Antivirus aids users and organizations in remaining protected on new and emerging threats. Moreover, standardizing the use of the Microsoft Edge browser across all corporate devices and enabling Microsoft Defender SmartScreen protection blocks malicious sites, such as those connected to ZLoader campaigns.",
                        "The ZLoader operators have tended to use REG.RU, LLC as the registrar for these final .site domains. Additionally, many of the domains used within a single campaign have the registrant contact email in common with each other, making it easy to pivot and find other potentially related domains.",

                        "The .bat file launches PowerShell to reach out to a download domain to drop the ZLoader payload. Examples of these domains include:",
                        "Less complex ZLoader campaigns go straight from the delivery phase to dropping the malicious payload. In more complex ZLoader campaigns, the next phase of the attack shifts to using a legitimate process such as msiexec.exe to download several additional files, including many non-malicious .dll files that are legitimate pieces of whatever software is being impersonated at the time. A malicious .bat file is hidden in those .dll files.",
                        "In several campaigns, attackers opted not to use these modules and instead used the payload to download an additional malicious file. This file was launched and then called back out to the same download domain that the ZLoader payload was downloaded from, to download a PowerShell script. The downloaded script checked if the device was workgroup- or domain-connected. The PowerShell script then reached out to the command and control (C2) domain and downloaded two malicious filestypically an .exe and a .dll. The script used regsvr32.exe to launch the DLL and run a command to time out for 200 seconds. After this, cmd.exe was used to launch an additional malicious file, which downloads a VBS file that is loaded by wscript.",
                        "ZLoader operators have also attempted to perform defense evasion by disabling security tools. In many instances, ZLoader will drop a file, frequently a .bat file, that then uses PowerShell to turn off and alter security settings, such as excluding all .dll and .exe files and regsvr32.exe from being scanned.",
                        "ZLoader campaign operators evolved the malware from a basic banking trojan to a more sophisticated piece of malware capable of monetizing compromised devices by selling access to other affiliate groups. By leveraging and misusing legitimate tools like Cobalt Strike and Splashtop, affiliates gain hands-on-keyboard access to affected devices, which can be further misused for other malicious activities like credential theft or downloading additional payloads, including ransomware. ZLoader has previously been linked to ransomware infections such as Ryuk, DarkSide, and BlackMatter.",

Several of Microsofts main websites, such as office[.]com, redirect users to this Microsoft online page when they try to sign into their Microsoft account. When users load their favorite web browser, such as Microsoft Edge, then visit and try to sign into their Microsoft account, ZLoader will match the URL to the list of targets. In this case it will match to the first one above and perform the web injection by inserting malicious JavaScript codes after the string </head> and then rendering to the browser application.",

ZLoader has remained relevant as attackers tool of choice by including defense evasion capabilities, like disabling security and antivirus tools, and selling access-as-a-service to other affiliate groups, such as ransomware operators. Its capabilities include capturing screenshots, collecting cookies, stealing credentials and banking data, performing reconnaissance, launching persistence mechanisms, misusing legitimate security tools, and providing remote access to attackers."

ZLoader operators frequently monetize access from infections by selling it to other affiliate groups, who then use the purchased access to carry out their own malicious objectives.

                        "Like many modern malware variants, getting ZLoader onto a device is oftentimes just the first step in what ends up being a larger attack. The trojan further exemplifies the trend of common malware increasingly harboring more dangerous threats, a pattern also observed in other platforms. ZLoader operators frequently monetize access from infections by selling it to other affiliate groups, who then use the purchased access to carry out their own malicious objectives. Affiliates may further misuse legitimate tools like Cobalt Strike or Splashtop to gain full hands-on-keyboard access to target devices, enabling attackers to perform additional discovery, find high-value targets on the network, move laterally, and drop additional payloads, such as ransomware variants.",

                        "Like many modern malware variants, getting ZLoader onto a device is oftentimes just the first step in what ends up being a larger attack. The trojan further exemplifies the trend of common malware increasingly harboring more dangerous threats, a pattern also observed in other platforms. ZLoader operators frequently monetize access from infections by selling it to other affiliate groups, who then use the purchased access to carry out their own malicious objectives. Affiliates may further misuse legitimate tools like Cobalt Strike or Splashtop to gain full hands-on-keyboard access to target devices, enabling attackers to perform additional discovery, find high-value targets on the network, move laterally, and drop additional payloads, such as ransomware variants.",
                        "Derived from the Zeus banking trojan first discovered in 2007, ZLoader is a malware family notable for its ability to evolve and change from campaign to campaign, having undergone much development since its inception. ZLoader has remained relevant as attackers tool of choice by including defense evasion capabilities, like disabling security and antivirus tools, and selling access-as-a-service to other affiliate groups, such as ransomware operators. Its capabilities include capturing screenshots, collecting cookies, stealing credentials and banking data, performing reconnaissance, launching persistence mechanisms, misusing legitimate security tools, and providing remote access to attackers.",
                        "ZLoaders prevalence in the threat landscape demands comprehensive protection capable of detecting and stopping this malware, its components, and other similar threats at every stage of the attack chain. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provides next-generation protection that reinforces network security perimeters and incorporates antimalware capabilities to catch emerging threats, including ZLoader, Cobalt Strike, additional payloads such as ransomware, and subsequent attacker behaviors. Moreover, our endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities detect ZLoaders malicious files, behaviors, domain connections, and other related events before and after execution.",
                        "After establishing persistence, the campaign operators behind ZLoader infections monetize their access to domain-joined devices by selling access-as-a-service to other groups, including ransomware affiliates. These groups can then use this access for their own goals, including installations of Cobalt Strike, which enables hands-on keyboard activities by the actors.",
                        "In the past, ZLoader has been tied to ransomware infections such as Ryuk. Weve also seen ZLoader operators provide access to ELBRUS actors who deployed DarkSide ransomware (earlier in 2021). Those that were more recently observed had been deploying BlackMatter ransomware. Given such history, the Cobalt Strike payloads might indicate pre-ransomware activities that prefigure a real threat of ransomware attacks.",
                        "As announced today, Microsoft took action against the ZLoader trojan by working with telecommunications providers around the world to disrupt key ZLoader infrastructure. We used our research into this threat to enrich our protection technologies and ensure this infrastructure could no longer be leveraged by operators to distribute the trojan or activate deployed payloads like ransomware. Moreover, we are sharing this intelligence to emphasize the importance of collaboration throughout the larger security community. Below, we will detail the various aspects for identifying a ZLoader campaign.",
                        "With the use of Cobalt Strike and Splashtop, attackers have hands-on-keyboard access to affected devices that can be leveraged for subsequent objectives, including credential theft or deployment of additional payloads such as ransomware.",
                        "ZLoader attacks have affected nations around the world, with the majority targeting the US, China, western Europe, and Japan. Due to the modular nature of some of ZLoaders capabilities and its constant shifts in techniques, different ZLoader campaigns may look nothing alike. Previous campaigns have been fairly simple, with the malware delivered via malicious Office macros attached to emails and then used to deploy modules for capabilities. Other, more recent campaigns are notably complexinjecting malicious code into legitimate processes, disabling antivirus solutions, and ultimately culminating in ransomware.",
                        "ZLoader campaign operators evolved the malware from a basic banking trojan to a more sophisticated piece of malware capable of monetizing compromised devices by selling access to other affiliate groups. By leveraging and misusing legitimate tools like Cobalt Strike and Splashtop, affiliates gain hands-on-keyboard access to affected devices, which can be further misused for other malicious activities like credential theft or downloading additional payloads, including ransomware. ZLoader has previously been linked to ransomware infections such as Ryuk, DarkSide, and BlackMatter.",

                        "Like many modern malware variants, getting ZLoader onto a device is oftentimes just the first step in what ends up being a larger attack. The trojan further exemplifies the trend of common malware increasingly harboring more dangerous threats, a pattern also observed in other platforms. ZLoader operators frequently monetize access from infections by selling it to other affiliate groups, who then use the purchased access to carry out their own malicious objectives. Affiliates may further misuse legitimate tools like Cobalt Strike or Splashtop to gain full hands-on-keyboard access to target devices, enabling attackers to perform additional discovery, find high-value targets on the network, move laterally, and drop additional payloads, such as ransomware variants.",
                        "Derived from the Zeus banking trojan first discovered in 2007, ZLoader is a malware family notable for its ability to evolve and change from campaign to campaign, having undergone much development since its inception. ZLoader has remained relevant as attackers tool of choice by including defense evasion capabilities, like disabling security and antivirus tools, and selling access-as-a-service to other affiliate groups, such as ransomware operators. Its capabilities include capturing screenshots, collecting cookies, stealing credentials and banking data, performing reconnaissance, launching persistence mechanisms, misusing legitimate security tools, and providing remote access to attackers.",

This diagram is high-level and may not depict every step or file dropped in some of ZLoaders more complex campaigns.",

We used our research into this threat to enrich our protection technologies and ensure this infrastructure could no longer be leveraged by operators to distribute the trojan or activate deployed payloads like ransomware. Moreover, we are sharing this intelligence to emphasize the importance of collaboration throughout the larger security community. Below, we will detail the various aspects for identifying a ZLoader campaign.",

ZLoader has remained relevant as attackers tool of choice by including defense evasion capabilities, like disabling security and antivirus tools, and selling access-as-a-service to other affiliate groups, such as ransomware operators. Its capabilities include capturing screenshots, collecting cookies, stealing credentials and banking data, performing reconnaissance, launching persistence mechanisms, misusing legitimate security tools, and providing remote access to attackers.",

Included in the configuration are the list of target banks, financial institutions, and online companies, and the instruction on how to perform the web injection.",
                        "The emails have used a variety of lures, which typically convey a sense of urgency. Some of the campaigns used lures based on currents events at the time of the campaign, such COVID-19, or generic lures, such as overdue invoice payments and fake resumes or CVs. Additionally, most of these emails have been sent from consumer email servicesnotablyAOL.com. There have also been campaigns that used domains that are associated with the lure theme; for example, some emails were sent from a COVID-themed sender domain.",
                        "One of the main functionalities of ZLoader malware is to steal online credentials targeting banks and financial institutions, as well as other credentials, via client-side web injection and form grabbing attacks. Web injection allows the attacker to alter content of the websites displayed to the victim, while form grabbing captures credentials from the browser windows. To accomplish those actions, the malware implements an Adversary-in-the-browser (AiTB) attack.",
                        "ZLoader campaign operators evolved the malware from a basic banking trojan to a more sophisticated piece of malware capable of monetizing compromised devices by selling access to other affiliate groups. By leveraging and misusing legitimate tools like Cobalt Strike and Splashtop, affiliates gain hands-on-keyboard access to affected devices, which can be further misused for other malicious activities like credential theft or downloading additional payloads, including ransomware. ZLoader has previously been linked to ransomware infections such as Ryuk, DarkSide, and BlackMatter.",

This file was launched and then called back out to the same download domain that the ZLoader payload was downloaded from, to download a PowerShell script. The downloaded script checked if the device was workgroup- or domain-connected. The PowerShell script then reached out to the command and control (C2) domain and downloaded two malicious filestypically an .exe and a .dll. The script used regsvr32.exe to launch the DLL and run a command to time out for 200 seconds. After this, cmd.exe was used to launch an additional malicious file, which downloads a VBS file that is loaded by wscript."

Due to the modular nature of some of ZLoaders capabilities and its constant shifts in techniques, different ZLoader campaigns may look nothing alike. Previous campaigns have been fairly simple, with the malware delivered via malicious Office macros attached to emails and then used to deploy modules for capabilities. Other, more recent campaigns are notably complexinjecting malicious code into legitimate processes, disabling antivirus solutions, and ultimately culminating in ransomware."
