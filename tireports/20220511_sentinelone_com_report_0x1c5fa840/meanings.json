I recommend its use during an initial investigations learning phase, and once complete or at a level of confidence, storing the data (as appropriate) in a central platform like the Vertex Projects Synapse.

Timelining threat campaigns is incredibly useful for many reasons. For one, we are often faced with complex incidents that need a form of documentation to enable the identification of new context. Being able to see how events relate to one another is powerful because it allows a researcher to organize complex threat activity and highlight context an actor cannot easily fabricate, even when considering specific misdirection techniques like file timestomping."
