                        "Kazy Crypter has been sold in many underground forums and markets since 2014. The cost of this crypter averages between 13 USD to 30 USD depending on the number of days it will be used and it is advertised as fully compatible with most of the well-known RATs available in the market such as LuminosityLink, NanoCore, etc. Nowadays, though its not used very often, there was a submission of the Kazy Loader module to VT during the 1st week of March along with the source code of Kazy Crypter. This blog gives you the complete analysis of Kazy Crypter and its loader functionalities.",
                        "Considering the time when the Kazy Crypter showed up, we can glean that it is pretty old and almost all the AV vendors have behaviour detections. But the fact that it was submitted to VT only recently with the latest compilation time means someone is again working on it or at least evaluating it. K7 Labs continuously monitors such kinds of malware, tools and campaigns to provide effective protection against all of them.",
                        "Then it proceeds to decrypt the payload that was compiled using the Kazy Crypter and stores it in an array as depicted in Figure 9. Once the decryption is complete, it then invokes and calls the entry point of the payload to execute the same."

The cost of this crypter averages between 13 USD to 30 USD depending on the number of days it will be used and it is advertised as fully compatible with most of the well-known RATs available in the market such as LuminosityLink, NanoCore, etc. Nowadays, though its not used very often, there was a submission of the Kazy Loader module to VT during the 1st week of March along with the source code of Kazy Crypter. This blog gives you the complete analysis of Kazy Crypter and its loader functionalities."
