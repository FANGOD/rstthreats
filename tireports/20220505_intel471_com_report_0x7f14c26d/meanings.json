                        "Conti and Emotet: A constantly destructive duo",
                        "Ransomware gangs are apparently no different. Thanks to the Conti Leaks, Intel 471 researchers found evidence that the Conti ransomware group kept a close eye on other ransomware groups and borrowed some of their techniques and best practices for its own operations. Additionally, Intel 471 also observed the Conti groups affiliates and managers cooperating with other gangs, which included the LockBit, Maze and Ryuk teams.",
                        "Our researchers found that in November 2021, two high-level Conti managers discussed a partnership with LockBit 2.0. The two managers apparently initially disagreed on the partnerships details, later clarifying it in a leaked conversation:",
                        "Also in early July 2020, Conti group members revealed they used Maze ransomware as a temporary stopgap while Conti was in development. (translated from Russian):",

                        "Move fast and commit crimes: Contis development teams mirror corporate tech",
                        "These chats, among others, show that high-level Conti managers were knowledgeable about Ryuk ransomware operations and most likely had direct access to the threat actors using it.",
                        "From reworking encryption algorithms, to copying sections of ransom notes, to using developers that worked on several different kinds of ransomware, Intel 471 found that Contis operations were powered by information gleaned from competitors.",
                        "On July 17, 2020, the head developer had a conversation with the senior manager, claiming to have changed the Contis cryptographic algorithm from the AES-256 block cipher to the ChaCha20 stream cipher, which increased encryption speed:",
                        "On Sept. 27, 2021, Contis open source intelligence (OSINT) team leader had a conversation that revealed he updated the groups ransom note by copying a portion of the text from the Ragnar Locker ransom note.",
                        "The Conti and Ryuk ransomware strains have widely been attributed to the same group, with Ryuk likely serving as a predecessor to Conti.",
                        "The metamorphosis of this strain has been debated for some time. Some research hypothesizes that Ryuk ransomware operators initially joined the Conti team as its own division in order to use TrickBot to distribute Ryuk, while others believe Conti was just a re-work of Ryuk.",
                        "This conversation lines up with what a LockBit 2.0 representative shared on an underground forum in April 2022, where they admitted that they had been in contact with Conti representatives primarily due to interest in using TrickBot.",
                        "Intel 471 researchers found chats that revealed Contis alleged coder claimed to have copied features from Maze ransomware while developing Conti.",
                        "However the metamorphosis occurred, its clear from the Conti Leaks chats that top-level Conti operatives had direct access to actors who were behind Ryuk. Intel 471 researchers found conversations tied to one of Contis senior managers that contained multiple references to the group behind Ryuk.",
                        "A few weeks later, Conti was in steady use, becoming one of the most active ransomware strains in the latter half of the year."
