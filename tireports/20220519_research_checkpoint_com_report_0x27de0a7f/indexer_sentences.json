Research suggests that another target in Belarus, likely also related to the research field, received a similar spear-phishing email claiming that the US is allegedly spreading a biological weapon. The defense research institutes that we identified as targets of this attack belong to a holding company within the Russian state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec Corporation. It is Russias largest holding company in the radio-electronics industry and the specific targeted research institutes primary focus is the development and manufacturing of electronic warfare systems, military-specialized onboard radio-electronic equipment, air-based radar stations and means of state identification. This campaign is a continuation of what CPR believes to be a long-running espionage operation against Russian-related entities that has been in operation since at least June 2021. The operation may still be ongoing, as the most recent activity was observed in April 2022. This activity was attributed with high confidence to a Chinese threat actor, with possible connections to Stone Panda (aka APT10), a sophisticated and experienced nation-state-backed actor, and Mustang Panda, another proficient China-based cyber espionage threat actor. CPR named this campaign Twisted Panda to reflect the sophistication of the tools observed and the attribution to China. The hackers use new tools, which have not previously been described: a sophisticated multi-layered loader and a backdoor dubbed SPINNER. These tools are in development since at least March 2021 and use advanced evasion and anti-analysis techniques such as multi-layer in-memory loaders and compiler-level obfuscations."}

Interestingly, the actors chose not to add more exported functions to the DLL, but to handle different call reasons in DllMain, making some parts of malicious code run stealthy in the background when the document is closed. Although the loader contains some anti-analysis and evasion techniques, such as the use of shellcode and dynamic API resolving using hashed, in the latest campaign the actors added significant improvements by supplementing complex compiler-level obfuscations to the SPINNER backdoor. In addition to the complex obfuscations, the SPINNER backdoor was reduced to only basic functionality. This was likely done to increase the malwares stealth and evasion."}

At first glance, the payload looked similar to the PlugX/Hodur malware described by ESET in a recently published report on Chinese APT Mustang Panda. The first similarity is in the ID numbering of C&C commands: both malware use 2 bytes to specify the command category and 2 bytes for a specific command from this category. For example, the command 0x10010001 is used in the SPINNER variant to send the system information data, while Hodur malware uses the command group 0x1001 and command ID 0x1001 for the same action."}

These functionalities are not unique and can usually be found in many backdoors. In this case, the two malware share an even greater and more surprising similarity. After opening the Hodur PlugX variant in the disassembler, it became apparent that Hodur like SPINNER was heavily obfuscated using Control Flow Flattening (CFF). However, Hodurs CFF is different from SPINNERs. Hodurs CFF relies on a dispatcher that uses a certain register to decide which code block to jump to next, while in SPINNER the register is used as-is without any manipulation. In the PlugX variant, additional arithmetic operations are used on the register before it is checked by the dispatcher. To complete the obfuscation comparison, Hodur heavily obfuscates its API calls and strings, a step which is absent in SPINNER."}

The self-delete function in Hodur might be similar in its logic to SPINNER, but it uses a completely different set of commands to delete itself and its associated files. Hodurs communication logic with the C&C is more complex, drawn from different parts of the code and from multiple threads, while SPINNER has only has one function that handles the commands."}

In addition to the similarities between SPINNER and Hodur that we previously mentioned, other practices like multi-layer in-memory loaders based on shellcodes and PEs, especially combined with dynamic API resolutions via hashes, are also a signature technique for many Chinese groups. The victimology of the Twisted Panda campaign is consistent with Chinese long-term interests."}
