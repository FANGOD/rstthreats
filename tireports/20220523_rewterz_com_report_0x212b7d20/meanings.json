                        "NjRat is a Remote Access Trojan, which is found leveraging Pastebin to deliver a second-stage payload after initial infection. There are multiple versions of the secondary payload used, ranging from base64 encoded version, hexadecimal, JSON data format, compressed blobs, and also plain text data with malicious URLs embedded within. This is done in order to evade detection by security products and increase the possibility of operating unnoticed. njRat is developed in .NET framework and is able to hijack the functions of a compromised machine remotely, including taking screenshots, exfiltrating data, keylogging, and killing processes such as antivirus programs, while also connecting the machine to a botnet. RAT was also found abusing Windows API functions such as Windows API calls such as GetKeyboardState(), GetAsynckeyState(), MapVirtualKey() for keylogging, and data theft. It was also discovered downloading web scraping tools such as proxy scrapper in order to extract large amounts of data via proxies"
