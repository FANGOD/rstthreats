                        "Many of the original Mirai features have made their way to existing variants, such as setting up signal-based control flow to make dynamic analysis harder; self-deleting the executable; changing the process name and the command line to avoid detection; preventing system reboot; stopping processes associated with remote administration tools like SSH and Telnet; stopping competing malware processes; and searching for new targets to infect. But, newer variants have slightly different implementations or add new exploit capabilities to increase the attack surface.",
                        "Popular for compromising internet-connected devices and conducting distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, Mirai malware variants have been known to compromise devices that run on Linux builds ranging from mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) devices to cloud infrastructures.",
                        "Figure 1. Mirai variants distribution based on builds compiled for specific CPU architectures (Q1 2021 vs Q1 2022)",
                        "According to internal and open-source data analyzed by the CrowdStrike malware research team, while the ARM CPU architecture (used in most mobile and IoT devices) remains the most prevalent among Mirai variants, the number of 32-bit x86 Mirai variants (used on Linux servers and networking equipment) increased by 120% in Q1 2022 compared to Q1 2021. ARM-compiled variants increased by only 10% during the same timespan, according to internal and open-source data analyzed by CrowdStrike researchers. On average, the number of Mirai variants compiled for both 32- and 64-bit x86 CPU architectures has increased by 101% during the same timespan.",
                        "While brute-force attacks to log in to internet-connected devices remain a preferred method for spreading various Mirai variants, going for devices with high-bandwidth, low-latency internet connections and higher computing power requires new methods for compromise, moving away from smart devices to more powerful Linux-running devices.",
                        "Figure 4. CrowdStrike Falcon detects Mirai x86 upx-packed Linux sample using on-sensor machine learning (3d9487191dd4e712cbfb8f4dcf916a707f60c3fb23807d4c02fb941e216f951d) (Click to enlarge)",
                        "Minimum recommendations for preventing Mirai infection on IoT devices involve using custom passwords, updated software and recent hardware, if possible.",
                        "Read more about the increase in malware targeting Linux-based operating systems in this blog: Linux-Targeted Malware Increases by 35% in 2021: XorDDoS, Mirai and Mozi Most Prevalent.<crlf>Read this press release about CrowdStrike Falcons enhanced Linux protection.<crlf>Find out how the powerful CrowdStrike Falcon platform provides comprehensive protection across your organization, workers, data and identities.<crlf>Get a full-featured free trial of CrowdStrike Falcon Prevent and learn how true next-gen AV performs against todays most sophisticated threats.",
                        "For example, whenever a new exploit becomes public, such as the recent Log4j vulnerability, its quickly integrated by malware developers into various Mirai variants. The Log4j logging library is used by countless applications and is not limited to applications running on a specific operating system or CPU architecture.",
                        "Figure 3. Mirai variant exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability (8d80490b35ebb3f75f568ed4a9e8a7de28254c2f7a6458b4c61888572a64197e)",
                        "The CrowdStrike Falcon platform protects Linux workloads, including containers, whether they run in public and private clouds, on-premises or in hybrid data centers. To effectively detect and protect against Mirai variants, CrowdStrike researchers continuously analyze and understand how they operate and how they continue to evolve to build better automated detection capabilities.",
                        "Whats special about Mirai is that its source code and instructions on how to set the botnet were made public in late 2016 by its developer, and traces of that original code can now be found in multiple recent Mirai variants.",

But, newer variants have slightly different implementations or add new exploit capabilities to increase the attack surface.",

ARM-compiled variants increased by only 10% during the same timespan, according to internal and open-source data analyzed by CrowdStrike researchers. On average, the number of Mirai variants compiled for both 32- and 64-bit x86 CPU architectures has increased by 101% during the same timespan.",
