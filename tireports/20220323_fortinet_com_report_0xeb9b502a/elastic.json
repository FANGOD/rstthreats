Stolen personally identifiable information (PII), credential theft, monetary loss, etc.\nSeverity Level: Medium\nMalicious email and phishing scams are usually topical and follow a pattern of current events. They are usually crafted around calendar and/or trending issues as attackers realize that victims are interested in all things relevant to the moment. Threat actors are aware that not all recipients will bite, but some will, hence the origination of the term phishing.\nThreat actors often put in the least amount of work possible for a maximum return, sending out phishing emails to thousands of targets. Even if less than one percent of victims respond, the return on investment is still significant due to the gain of personally identifiable information (PII) and/or establishing a foothold within an organization using stolen credentials, malware, or other means.\nThis blog highlights some examples weve encountered that may help users better spot suspicious emails. Recent examples observed by FortiGuard Labs include emails related to tax season and the Ukrainian conflict, which reflect the timeliness of current and newsworthy events at the time of writing."

The first is a malicious email pretending to originate from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) containing a maliciously crafted Microsoft Excel file to deliver malware (Emotet). The second is a phishing scam that asks a recipient to send personally identifiable information (PII) via written correspondence to a phone number."

Fake IRS email with malicious attachment\nFor those not familiar with Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification), it is used by U.S. individuals to provide a correct taxpayer identification number (TIN) to payers (or brokers) who are required to file information returns with the IRS. Red flags that this is a phishing scam include the non-capitalization of assistant and the incorrect usage of Treasure instead of Treasury in the signature body. It should also be noted that the IRS does not communicate with U.S. taxpayers via email and instead uses the traditional postal service for all communications."

It does this without user interaction, performing its behind-the-scenes magic to download a copy of Emotet from multiple remote locations:\nFigure 3.

The move came as no surprise because the feature is continuously abused by threat actors. Other welcome news from Microsoft is the restricted usage of macros in Access, Excel, PowerPoint, Visio, and Word by default starting in April 2022 via the disablement of VBA macros (also abused by Emotet). Based on the examples shown above, we can see this did not deter the attacker one bit from abusing Excel 4.0 macros.\nAlso, administrators are able to control the usage of Excel 4.0 macros via group policy settings, as well as cloud and ADMX policies. This feature was introduced in July 2021. For more details, please visit Microsofts tech community page - Restrict usage of Excel 4.0 (XLM) macros with new macro settings control.\nIts important to note that these potential victims were not targeted. Emotet utilizes what is colloquially known in the industry as a spray and pray tactic to spread via malicious email campaigns. Emotet is known to have delivered other malware variants in the past, with the most disruptive being ransomware. Some ransomware as a service (RaaS) groups have specific policies to not deploy ransomware to government sectors, defense industry, and other critical infrastructures (hospitals, etc.). However, actual attacks are often carried out by RaaS affiliates who may or may not abide by the policy set by RaaS groups."

This example contains an attachment, titled W8-ENFORM.PDF. While not malicious, this PDF file is essentially a photocopy of the IRS W-8 form. It is simply the W8 form from the IRS with an appended number added by the bad actors at the end of the document.\nRed flags within the body of the email are the improper usage of grammar, typos, and punctuation:\nFigure 5. W-8 themed tax scam\nThis scam uses social engineering verbiage to target nonresident aliens of the United States based on official records discovery. However, in a weird miscue, the email contains a contradictory statement:\nif you are a USA citizen and resident, this W8BEN-FORM is not meant for you\nThe email continues with instructions to reply back and to state on the attached form that the recipient is, indeed, a U.S. citizen/resident. After this step is completed, the bad actor provides a different form to complete.\nFigure 6. W-8 Form\nFigure 7. W8 Form with added phone number to document\nOnce this form is filled out, all PII included on this form appears to be sent to an 806 phone number, which is the area code for the state of Texas. As of the time of writing this number has an active fax service, which most likely is internet-based and can receive the content and distribute as an attachment to the malicious actor anywhere in the world. It is possible, if there are a lot of respondents, they could be using OCR (Optical Image Recognition) image technology to store victim data in a database for later use.\nIt is important to again note that the IRS does not handle any official correspondence via email. Official W-9 forms are available on the IRS Web page. Official W8 forms can be found here."

            "text": "With the current tragic situation in Ukraine unfolding, internal chatter within ransomware groups have surfaced. Some ransomware groups side with Russia and other groups side with the West. A well-known RaaS group (which used Emotet)that we will not publicize for obvious reasonshas made a very strong statement that any attacks directed towards Russia will be met with a retaliatory act towards the West.\nAs the situation is fluid, and with potentially compromised government sectors likely being infected or targeted with ransomware at this very moment either for monetary or political reasons, this threat is not out of the question. The point is that important sectors such as government agencies are no longer exempt from attacks, especially from Emotet threat actors, regardless of bias or opinion.\nPhishing scams arent going anywhere. They are a part of the threat landscape and will likely always be a component of an attackers arsenal. This is because the return on investment for an attacker is very high. A crafted email containing specific language designed to trick users into opening an attachment, following a link, responding with confidential or sensitive information, etc. will always work on a percentage of targets. This is because of the one major weakness security software cannot address: the human element.\nTraining programs constantly remind and teach users how to spot malicious email/phishing/spearphishing scams for a good reason. Out of thousands of recipients, it only takes a few to respond to make it all worthwhile to an attacker. And when the right person falls prey it can unleash a trove of information to the attacker that can be exploited for various purposes. Although such scams are well known and publicized, they are still pervasive for one simple factthey work and will continue to work for the foreseeable future."
