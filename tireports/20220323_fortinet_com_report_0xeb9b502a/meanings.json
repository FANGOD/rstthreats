                        "Microsoft announced in January 2022 that Excel 4.0 macros are disabled by default starting in Excel (Build 16.0.14427.10000). The move came as no surprise because the feature is continuously abused by threat actors. Other welcome news from Microsoft is the restricted usage of macros in Access, Excel, PowerPoint, Visio, and Word by default starting in April 2022 via the disablement of VBA macros (also abused by Emotet). Based on the examples shown above, we can see this did not deter the attacker one bit from abusing Excel 4.0 macros.",

                        "Its important to note that these potential victims were not targeted. Emotet utilizes what is colloquially known in the industry as a spray and pray tactic to spread via malicious email campaigns. Emotet is known to have delivered other malware variants in the past, with the most disruptive being ransomware. Some ransomware as a service (RaaS) groups have specific policies to not deploy ransomware to government sectors, defense industry, and other critical infrastructures (hospitals, etc.). However, actual attacks are often carried out by RaaS affiliates who may or may not abide by the policy set by RaaS groups.",
                        "The following set of examples highlights two IRS/tax-themed scams. The first is a malicious email pretending to originate from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) containing a maliciously crafted Microsoft Excel file to deliver malware (Emotet). The second is a phishing scam that asks a recipient to send personally identifiable information (PII) via written correspondence to a phone number.",
