                        "From January 2021 to March 2022, Jocker most frequently attacked users in Saudi Arabia (21.20%). Poland came second (8.98%) with Germany in third place (6.01%).",
                        "Trojan.AndroidOS.MobOk works on a principle similar to the malware described in the previous section. A subscription page is opened in an invisible window and a confirmation code stolen from a text message is stealthily entered there. If the malware is downloaded by Triada, it inherits Triadas access to text messages, but if MobOk is spread by itself, it will request access to notifications, similarly to Jocker.",
                        "Once launched, the malware downloads and launches a new file which inherits permissions from the infected app. The earliest versions of the Trojan downloaded the subscription app straight away. But presently Jocker is a staged downloader.",

The malware poses as apps for recovering deleted files, editing photos and videos, blinking the flash for incoming calls, navigation, document scanning, translation, and so on. Yet all these apps can do in practice is request a phone number under the pretense of a login, although clicking login will actually subscribe the user. This is the simplest form of subscription it bills the cell phone account and all it needs to complete the process is the victims phone number.
