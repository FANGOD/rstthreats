                        "As you can see in this attack, LemonDuck utilized some part of its vast C2 operation to target Linux and Docker in addition to its Windows campaigns. It utilized techniques to evade defenses not only by using disguised files and by killing monitoring daemon, but also by disabling Alibaba Clouds monitoring service.",
                        "LemonDuck is a well-known cryptomining botnet involved in targeting Microsoft Exchange servers via ProxyLogon and the use of EternalBlue, BlueKeep, etc. to mine cryptocurrency, escalate privileges and move laterally in compromised networks. This botnet tries to monetize its efforts via various simultaneous active campaigns to mine cryptocurrency like Monero.",
                        "Attackers usually run a single campaign from a single C2 server, but interestingly, on multiple C2 used by LemonDuck, there are multiple campaigns running that target Windows as well as the Linux platform. Figure 5 shows various dropper files used in multiple campaigns.",
                        "The CrowdStrike Cloud Threat Research team detected LemonDuck targeting Docker to mine cryptocurrency on the Linux platform. This campaign is currently active.",
                        "LemonDuck targets exposed Docker APIs to get initial access. It runs a malicious container on an exposed Docker API by using a custom Docker ENTRYPOINT to download a core.png image file that is disguised as Bash script. In Figure 1, you can see the initial malicious entrypoint.",
                        "Due to the cryptocurrency boom in recent years, combined with cloud and container adoption in enterprises, cryptomining is proven to be a monetarily attractive option for attackers. Since cloud and container ecosystems heavily use Linux, it drew the attention of the operators of botnets like LemonDuck, which started targeting Docker for cryptomining on the Linux platform.",
                        "Figure 2. LemonDuck domain certificate",
                        "LemonDuck, a well-known cryptomining botnet, is targeting Docker to mine cryptocurrency on Linux systems. This campaign is currently active.<crlf>It runs an anonymous mining operation by the use of proxy pools, which hide the wallet addresses.<crlf>It evades detection by targeting Alibaba Clouds monitoring service and disabling it.<crlf>CrowdStrike customers are protected from this threat with the Falcon Cloud Workload Protection module.",
                        "The file core.png was downloaded from a domain t.m7n0y[.]com, which is associated with LemonDuck. By further analyzing this domain, CrowdStrike found multiple campaigns being operated via the domain targeting Windows and Linux platforms simultaneously.",
                        "Rather than mass scanning the public IP ranges for exploitable attack surface, LemonDuck tries to move laterally by searching for SSH keys on filesystem. This is one of the reasons this campaign was not evident as other mining campaigns run by other groups. Once SSH keys are found, the attacker uses those to log in to the servers and run the malicious scripts as discussed earlier. Figure 10 shows the search for SSH keys on the filesystem."
