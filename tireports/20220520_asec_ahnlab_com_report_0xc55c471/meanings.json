                        "As the ransomware was found to be distributed using the AD group policy, AhnLab attempted to conduct a DC server forensic analysis. However, as the virtual environment operating system of the DC server operating in the virtual environment was damaged, the server could not be secured. Among the systems that were restored by the previous backup after the infection, the two WebLogic servers were found to be infected by WebShell during a similar period. AhnLab conducted the forensic analysis on the servers to check if WebShell was responsible for the Darkside infection.",

However, there were Miner infections starting from April 2019, and there was a history of various malware infections and breach traces until February 2022 (the time of the analysis).",

                        "WAS1 was infected with CoinMiner in 2019. It was later infected with various malware types such as Cobalt Strike, WebShell, and info-leaking malware. It appears that the breach had been progressing for the recent 2-3 years by the various attackers. WAS2 had a malware strain likely created by a North Korean hacker, meaning it was probably being targeted by an APT attack. There were also various breach traces discovered on April 22, 2021, but the targeted company stated that it received a penetration testing service on that day."
