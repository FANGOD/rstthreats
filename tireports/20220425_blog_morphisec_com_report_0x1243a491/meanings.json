                        "Core Impact is a penetration testing framework developed by Core Security. As with other penetration testing frameworks, these arent always used with good intentions. TrendMicro reported a modified version of Core Impact was used in the Woolen-GoldFish campaign tied to the Rocket Kitten APT35 group.",
                        "Morphisec is a world leader in preventing evasive polymorphic threats launched from zero-day exploits. On April 14 and 15, Morphisec identified exploitation attempts for a week-old VMware Workspace ONE Access (formerly VMware Identity Manager) remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. BleepingComputer reports similar attempts have been seen in the wild. Due to indicators of a sophisticated Core Impact backdoor, Morphisec believes advanced persistent threat (APT) groups are behind these VMWare identity manager attack events. The tactics, techniques, and procedures used in the attack are common among groups such as the Iranian linked Rocket Kitten."

BleepingComputer reports similar attempts have been seen in the wild. Due to indicators of a sophisticated Core Impact backdoor, Morphisec believes advanced persistent threat (APT) groups are behind these VMWare identity manager attack events. The tactics, techniques, and procedures used in the attack are common among groups such as the Iranian linked Rocket Kitten.",

These beacons are highly evasive and can bypass the AV, EDR, MDR, and XDR deployed on endpoints. Morphisecs MTD technology provides early visibility and prevention of vulnerability exploitation.
