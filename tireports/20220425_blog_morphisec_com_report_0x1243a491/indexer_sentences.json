Anyone using VMWares identity access management should immediately apply the patches VMWare has released. Organizations unable to immediately apply the patch(es) should consider virtual patching. VMWare customers should also review their VMware architecture to ensure the affected components are not accidentally published on the internet, which dramatically increases the exploitation risks."}

Morphisecs MTD technology implements a virtual patch by creating a dynamic attack surface to prevent the successful deployment of CoreImpact, Cobalt Strike and Metasploit beacons. These beacons are highly evasive and can bypass the AV, EDR, MDR, and XDR deployed on endpoints. Morphisecs MTD technology provides early visibility and prevention of vulnerability exploitation. It enables quick containment without creating false positive alerts."}
