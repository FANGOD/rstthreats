            "text": "Lazarus APT is one of North Koreas most sophisticated threat actors, operating since at least 2009. Initially, they concentrated on South Korea. It has recently shifted its focus to worldwide targets and began initiating assaults for monetary gain. This actor has been linked to attacks in South Korea, the United States, Japan, and a number of other nations. Lazarus APT is suspected of being behind a number of diverse efforts, including cyberespionage, attacks on financial institutions, government agencies, and the military.\nThis group is said to be behind the wiper attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November 2014 as part of Novettas Operation Blockbuster campaign. Lazarus Groups malware is linked to other known campaigns such as Operation Flame, Operation Troy, DarkSeoul, Operation 1Mission, and Ten Days of Rain."
