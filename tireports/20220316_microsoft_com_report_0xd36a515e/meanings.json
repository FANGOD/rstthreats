                        "The Microsoft Defender for IoT research team has recently discovered the exact method through which MikroTik devices are used in Trickbots C2 infrastructure. In this blog, we will share our analysis of the said method and provide insights on how attackers gain access to MikroTik devices and use compromised IoT devices in Trickbot attacks.",
                        "This continuous evolution has seen Trickbot expand its reach from computers to Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as routers, with the malware updating its C2 infrastructure to utilize MikroTik devices and modules. MikroTik routers are widely used around the world across different industries. By using MikroTik routers as proxy servers for its C2 servers and redirecting the traffic through non-standard ports, Trickbot adds another persistence layer that helps malicious IPs evade detection by standard security systems.",
                        "The purpose of Trickbot for using MikroTik devices is to create a line of communication between the Trickbot-affected device and the C2 server that standard defense systems in the network are not able to detect. The attackers begin by hacking into a MikroTik router. They do this by acquiring credentials using several methods, which we will discuss in detail in the following section.",
                        "Trickbot, a sophisticated trojan that has evolved significantly since its discovery in 2016, has continually expanded its capabilities and, even with disruption efforts and news of its infrastructure going offline, it has managed to remain one of the most persistent threats in recent years. The malwares modular nature has allowed it to be increasingly adaptable to different networks, environments, and devices. In addition, it has grown to include numerous plug-ins, access-as-a-service backdoors for other malware like Ryuk ransomware, and mining capabilities. A significant part of its evolution also includes making its attacks and infrastructure more durable against detection, including continuously improving its persistence capabilities, evading researchers and reverse engineering, and finding new ways to maintain the stability of its command-and-control (C2) framework."

MikroTik routers are widely used around the world across different industries. By using MikroTik routers as proxy servers for its C2 servers and redirecting the traffic through non-standard ports, Trickbot adds another persistence layer that helps malicious IPs evade detection by standard security systems.",

We uncovered this attacker method by tracking traffic containing these SSH shell commands."

                        "Trickbot, a sophisticated trojan that has evolved significantly since its discovery in 2016, has continually expanded its capabilities and, even with disruption efforts and news of its infrastructure going offline, it has managed to remain one of the most persistent threats in recent years. The malwares modular nature has allowed it to be increasingly adaptable to different networks, environments, and devices. In addition, it has grown to include numerous plug-ins, access-as-a-service backdoors for other malware like Ryuk ransomware, and mining capabilities. A significant part of its evolution also includes making its attacks and infrastructure more durable against detection, including continuously improving its persistence capabilities, evading researchers and reverse engineering, and finding new ways to maintain the stability of its command-and-control (C2) framework."

By using MikroTik routers as proxy servers for its C2 servers and redirecting the traffic through non-standard ports, Trickbot adds another persistence layer that helps malicious IPs evade detection by standard security systems.",

                        "This continuous evolution has seen Trickbot expand its reach from computers to Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as routers, with the malware updating its C2 infrastructure to utilize MikroTik devices and modules. MikroTik routers are widely used around the world across different industries. By using MikroTik routers as proxy servers for its C2 servers and redirecting the traffic through non-standard ports, Trickbot adds another persistence layer that helps malicious IPs evade detection by standard security systems.",
                        "This analysis highlights the importance of keeping IoT devices secure in todays ever evolving threat environment. Using Microsoft threat data, Microsofts IoT and operational technology (OT) security experts established the exact methods that attackers use to leverage compromised IoT devices and gained knowledge that can help us better protect customers from threats.",
                        "This analysis has enabled us to develop a forensic tool to identify Trickbot-related compromise and other suspicious indicators on MikroTik devices. We published this tool to help customers ensure these IoT devices are not susceptible to these attacks. Were also sharing recommended steps for detection and remediating compromise if found, as well as general prevention steps to protect against future attacks.",
                        "The Microsoft Defender for IoT research team has recently discovered the exact method through which MikroTik devices are used in Trickbots C2 infrastructure. In this blog, we will share our analysis of the said method and provide insights on how attackers gain access to MikroTik devices and use compromised IoT devices in Trickbot attacks.",
                        "We have published the tool in GitHub and are sharing this tool with the broader community to encourage better intelligence-sharing in the field of IoT security and to help build better protections against threat actors abusing IoT devices.",
                        "As security solutions for conventional computing devices continue to evolve and improve, attackers will explore alternative ways to compromise target networks. Attack attempts against routers and other IoT devices are not new, and being unmanaged, they can easily be the weakest links in the network. Therefore, organizations should also consider these devices when implementing security policies and best practices."

                        "Trickbot, a sophisticated trojan that has evolved significantly since its discovery in 2016, has continually expanded its capabilities and, even with disruption efforts and news of its infrastructure going offline, it has managed to remain one of the most persistent threats in recent years. The malwares modular nature has allowed it to be increasingly adaptable to different networks, environments, and devices. In addition, it has grown to include numerous plug-ins, access-as-a-service backdoors for other malware like Ryuk ransomware, and mining capabilities. A significant part of its evolution also includes making its attacks and infrastructure more durable against detection, including continuously improving its persistence capabilities, evading researchers and reverse engineering, and finding new ways to maintain the stability of its command-and-control (C2) framework."
