<p>Procedure to apply the Workaround: </p>
<ol><li>Run View-Active-Admin-users.sql to see all administrators (readonly administrators also included) and run View-Active-Local-users.sql to see all local users who will be disabled. Make sure that View-Active-Admin-users.sql shows at least 1 provisioned (usually from a Directory) administrator </li><li>Run Disable_All_Local_users.sql to disable all local users and administrators </li><li>Run View-Active-Admin-users.sql to see which administrators now remain active. Only provisioned (usually Directory users) userType administrators should show here. </li><li>Login to Workspace ONE Access/VMware Identity Manager appliance using a sshclient as root user. Restart the service using the command “service horizon-workspace restart”. Repeat this process for all appliances in your environment. </li><li>Until the hotfixes are applied, do not create any new local users.</li></ol>
<p>Procedure to revert the Workaround: </p>
<p>Use these steps only after applying the Hotfixes or if there is a lock out </p>
<ol><li>Run Reenable_Disabled_Users.sql to enable the previously disabled users </li><li>Run View-Active-Admin-users.sql and View-Active-Local-users.sql to confirm that local users and administrators have been re-enabled </li></ol>
