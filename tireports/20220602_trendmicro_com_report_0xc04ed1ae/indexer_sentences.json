One notable difference is that GonnaCope, the earliest variant, does not collect user credentials from web browsers and list of applications, and does not enable RDP connections. Furthermore, it does not execute black.bat, the file that temporarily causes the machine to become inaccessible while the malware executes its payload. We also observed that the BTC address used by GonnaCope is different from the BTC address of the succeeding variants and it contains a different ransom note format. The variants also differ in their delivery shifting between arriving as an archive, executable files, or LNK files that drop the CMD-based ransomware. The payloads are also located in different parts of the chain, with some being found in the main CMD file, while others are found in files that are downloaded from Pastebin and Discord."}
