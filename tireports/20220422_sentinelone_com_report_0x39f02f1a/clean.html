<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>At the beginning of February 2022, SentinelLabs observed two samples of a new Nemty variant dubbed “Nokoyawa” (sample <a href="https://virustotal.com/gui/file/e097cde0f76df948f039584045acfa6bd7ef863141560815d12c3c6e6452dce4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/fefd1117c2f0ab88d8090bc3bdcb8213daf8065f12de1ee6a6c641e888a27eab" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2</a>).</li>
<li>SentinelLabs consider Nokoyawa to be an evolution of the previous Nemty strain, Karma.</li>
<li>The developers have attempted to enhance code responsible for excluding folders from encryption, but SentinelLabs analysis finds that the algorithm contains logical flaws.</li>
<li>In March, <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/c/nokoyawa-ransomware-possibly-related-to-hive-.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TrendMicro</a> suggested this ransomware bore some relation to <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/hive-attacks-analysis-of-the-human-operated-ransomware-targeting-healthcare/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hive</a>. We assess that Hive and Nokoyawa are different and that the latter is not a rebrand of Hive RaaS.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this post, we take a broader look at the similarities between Nokoyawa and <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/karma-ransomware-an-emerging-threat-with-a-hint-of-nemty-pedigree/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Karma</a> ransomware. Previous <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/c/nokoyawa-ransomware-possibly-related-to-hive-.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">researchers</a> have highlighted similarities in the attack chain between Nokoyawa and <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/hive-ransomware-deploys-novel-ipfuscation-technique/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hive ransomware</a>, concluding that “Nokoyawa is likely connected with Hive, as the two families share some striking similarities in their attack chain, from the tools used to the order in which they execute various steps.” Our analysis contradicts that finding, and we assess Nokoyawa is clearly an evolution of <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/karma-ransomware-an-emerging-threat-with-a-hint-of-nemty-pedigree/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Karma (Nemty)</a>, bearing no major code similarities to Hive.</p>
<h2>Nokoyawa and Karma Variant Similarities</h2>
<p>Both Nokoyawa and Karma variants manage multi-threaded encryption by creating an input/output (I/O) completion port (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/createiocompletionport" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CreateIoCompletionPort</a>), which allows communication between the thread responsible for the enumeration of files and the sub-threads (“2 * NumberOfProcessors”) responsible for the file encryption.</p>

<p>In both cases, public keys for the encryption and ransom note are encoded with <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/guide-encode-decoded-base64/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Base64</a>.</p>
<p>Like Karma, Nokoyawa accepts different command line parameters, although in the latter they are documented by the developer via a <code>-help</code> command.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_65898"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-65898" height="113" src="https://899029.smushcdn.com/2131410/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Nokoyawa-command-line-support.jpg?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=0" style="max-width:800px;height:auto;width:auto;" width="685"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-65898">Nokoyawa command line support</figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from the <code>-help</code> command, three other commands (<code>-network</code>, <code>-file</code>, and <code>-dir</code>) are also provided.</p>
<table>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>If the ransomware is executed without any parameter, it then encrypts the machine without enumerating and encrypting network resources.</p>
<p>One new parameter not observed in the Karma version is <code>-network</code>, which is responsible for encrypting network shares. Network enumeration is achieved by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnetwk/nf-winnetwk-wnetopenenumw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WNetOpenEnumW</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnetwk/nf-winnetwk-wnetenumresourcew" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WNetEnumResourceW</a>, and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnetwk/nf-winnetwk-wnetcloseenum" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WNetCloseEnum</a>.</p>
<p>There are no significant similarities between the ransom notes except the use of email for contact points. Karma variants contained an <code>.onion</code> link that was also present in the Karma ransom note. We did not find any <code>.onion</code> links in Nokoyawa code or ransom note.</p>

<p>The ransom note filename uses a similar format as the previous versions: <code>&lt;ransom_extension&gt;_&lt;note_name&gt;.txt</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>&lt;ransom_extension&gt;</code> string has been used for many different functions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>file extension of encrypted files</li>
<li>appended as data to an encrypted file</li>
<li>ransom note filename part</li>
<li>mutex (the NOKOYAWA variant is observed to not make use of Mutexes)</li>
<li>to denote files to be excluded from further processing (e.g., to avoid running in a loop)</li>
</ul>
<h2> Nokoyawa’s Flawed Encryption Routine</h2>
<p>During the file and folder enumeration, the new variant creates a hash of the enumerated folder and compares it to those of excluded folders. However, this custom hashing algorithm appears to have flaws as it doesn’t seem logical nor does it appear to work as expected.</p>
<p>Below is a Python representation of the hashing algorithm.</p>
def nokoyawa_dir_hashing(folder):
 folder_len = len(folder)
 # to unicode
 folder = '\x00'.join([c for c in folder])
 # initial hash value
 nhash = 0x1505
 i = 0
 while i &lt; folder_len:
 c = ord(folder[i])
 # to capital
 c = c if c &lt; 0x61 else c - 0x20
 # hashing
 nhash = ((nhash &lt;&lt; 5) + nhash) + c
 # flawed logic, taking only null bytes after 1st character.
 i += 2 if not c else 1
 return nhash &amp; 0xFFFFFFFF
<p>The implementation of this flawed hashing algorithm in some cases results in excluding multiple folders. Logically, one would expect there to be a 1:1 correlation between a hash and the folder to be excluded. However, the flawed code effectively makes it possible for multiple folders to be excluded based on a single hash. This code does not appear in Karma variants, which instead contain hardcoded strings denoting which folders to ignore during encryption.</p>
<p>The following table shows which folders the developers intended to skip during encryption.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hash</td>
<td>Folders Intended To Be Excluded</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0x11f299b5</td>
<td>program files</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0x78fb3995</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>For extensions, the ransomware doesn't have any hashing algorithm and compares the raw strings with the extracted extension of the file. The excluded extensions are <code>.exe</code>, <code>.dll</code>, and <code>.lnk</code>. Files containing "NOKOYAWA" are also excluded.</p>
<p>Both Nokoyawa and Karma variants dynamically load <code>bcrypt.dll</code> and call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/bcrypt/nf-bcrypt-bcryptgenrandom" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BCryptGenRandom</a> in order to generate 0x20 random bytes. They generate an ephemeral Sect233r1 key pair using the generated random bytes as the seed. The malware then uses the private ephemeral key and the public embedded key to generate a shared Salsa20 key, which is subsequently used for the file encryption. The Salsa20 nonce is hardcoded as <code>“lvcelvce”</code> in Nokoyawa, whereas in the Karma version it was <code>"11111111"</code>.</p>
<p>An I/O completion packet is sent to the thread responsible for encryption. The packet includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>File handle</li>
<li>File size</li>
<li>File data</li>
<li>Salsa20 key</li>
<li>Salsa nonce</li>
<li>public ephemeral key</li>
</ul>
<p>The encryption thread has a switch containing four cases, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Case 1: Writes encrypted content and decryption struct to file and appends "extension"/"variant name".</li>
<li>Case 2: Calculates validation SHA1 hash and encrypts file data with Salsa20.</li>
<li>Case 3: Closes File Handle and moves files with the new extension.</li>
<li>Case 4: Exits.</li>
</ul>
<p>In both variants, the initial switch case is "2".</p>

<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_65897"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-65897" height="392" src="https://899029.smushcdn.com/2131410/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Encryption-thread-case-handler.jpg?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=0" style="max-width:800px;height:auto;width:auto;" width="1230"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-65897">Encryption thread case handler</figcaption></figure>
<p>During Case 2, the malware adds a SHA1 checksum, which is possibly validated during the decryption phase. The method runs through the following logic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allocates 0x13 bytes (0x14 required for SHA1)</li>
<li>XORs Salsa key with a buffer of "6".</li>
<li>Concatenates file data to XORed Salsa key</li>
<li>Calculates SHA1.</li>
<li>XORs Salsa key with a buffer of "\".</li>
<li>Concatenates SHA1 hash to the second XORed Salsa key.</li>
<li>Calculates validation SHA1.</li>
<li>Validation SHA1 hash first 0x13 bytes are added to the encrypted file struct</li>
</ul>
<p>Files encrypted by Nokoyawa will have the following structure.</p>
struct nokoyawa_encrypted_file
{
 BYTE encrypted_file_data[file_size], // using salsa20
 BYTE public_ephemeral_key[0x40], // Sect233r1
 BYTE validation_hash[0x13], // last byte is chopped
 STRING ransomware_extension
}
<p>The private key required for decryption is held by the attacker. When made available to the victim, the decryption routine reads the struct, extracts the public ephemeral key and generates the Salsa 20 key using the private key. The encrypted data is then decrypted with the key and validated by replicating the validated hash.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Nokoyawa code similarity and structure suggest it to be an evolution of the previous Nemty strain, Karma. This appears to be another attempt from the developer to confuse attribution. At this time, the actor appears not to have or provide any onion leak page.</p>
<p>SentinelLabs could not validate previous research suggesting Nokoyawa is related to Hive. Given the lack of code similarities between the two and the lack of further correlating data, we can only suggest that earlier researchers' findings may be explained by the possibility of an affiliate using both Hive and Nokoyawa.</p>
<p>SentinelLabs continues to follow and analyze the development of Nemty ransomware variants.</p>
