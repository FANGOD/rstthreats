To see what would happen we placed the first URL in a web browser, equating to the emails instructions for the target to click on the provided link to access the fax document. Doing so brought us to the phishing site shown below. The webpage is fabricated. The victims email address is already provided, and the site only asks for the victims password.",

                        "As previously noted, the second and third URLs are identical. This is where things get interesting. When we checked out these URLs in a browser it appeared to look just like another run of the mill phishing site. The phishing URLs format is the victims email address and is referenced on the fragment part (#). The fragment was used to auto-populate the email address field in the webpage. This link contains a further explanation of URL fragments. By removing the fragment part of the URL containing the victims email address, most of the web graphics disappear, making the login page look rather bland."
