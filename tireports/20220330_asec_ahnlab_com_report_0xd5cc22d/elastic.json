            "text": "The ASEC analysis team is using the ASEC automatic analysis system RAPIT to categorize and respond to known malware. This post will list weekly statistics collected from March 14th, 2022 (Monday) to March 20th, 2022 (Sunday).\nFor the main category, info-stealer ranked top with 70.0%, followed by RAT (Remote Administration Tool) with 19.8%, downloader with 5.7%, banking malware with 3.6%, CoinMiner with 0.4%, and backdoor with 0.4%.\nTop 1 Formbook\nFormbook ranked first place with 26.3%.\nLike other info-stealer, it is mainly distributed through spam emails. The distributed file names are close to each other. As for the files shown in the list below, the embolden filenames changed the name of the parent folder and distributed them using email to their targets. In other words, it is assumed that the filename of the attachment (compressed file or folder in the file) is distributed after changing its name. Thus, users should be cautious when opening the attachments sent from unknown users.\nremittance_details.exe\nLIST_OF_.EXE\npurchase_Order.exe\nShipping_Documents.exe\nCopia_de_pago_bancario.exe\nMarch 15th 2022 Monthly Inspection Notification\\zuf8gpog5obhvls.exe\nBookOrder_(3)\\zuf8gpog5obhvls.exe\nNEW_ORDER_003DB52.exe\nSCAN_DOCUMENTS.exe\nContract(XX_Construction)\\ceqnotjaj1hudct.exe\nXX_Construction(March14th_Blueprint)\\rivhal1bfjf2hen.exe\nInternational_Document-194-Purchase_LOI-XX-dong\\rivhal1bfjf2hen.exe\nItemDetails\\rivhal1bfjf2hen.exe\nBG V.085(07)-REVISED DRAFT BL.exe\nEstimate bsgs p3 project Paint Work\\wsn3k09khinyfim.exe\nXXX\\wsn3k09khinyfim.exe\nMarch 15th 2022 Monthly Inspection Notification\\wsn3k09khinyfim.exe\nPAYMENT_COPY.exe\nOFFER.exe\nqoutation.exe\nINVOICE.exe\nKGA20-AC-B6 RFQ Mancuso Nro.6315-22 6313.exe\nbanking details.pdf.exe\nPROFORMA_INVOICE.exe\nAs Formbook is injected in a normal process that is in the directory of explorer.exe and system32, the malicious behaviors are performed by the normal process.
