                        "We came across this news and this tweet which spoke about how money lending apps (loan apps) on Google Play Store abuse and threaten the user, demanding exorbitant amounts of money. These money lending apps collect money with high interest rates and then threaten the user if there is any delay in repaying the dues and in some cases, even after clearing the dues the loan agent demands more money. If the user does not repay the demanded money, abusive messages/images of the user will be sent to all the contacts in the users device. There are many reports of users taking their own life as they were unable to withstand the harassment. And the more saddening part is that some of these apps are still available in Google Play Store."

                        "We came across this news and this tweet which spoke about how money lending apps (loan apps) on Google Play Store abuse and threaten the user, demanding exorbitant amounts of money. These money lending apps collect money with high interest rates and then threaten the user if there is any delay in repaying the dues and in some cases, even after clearing the dues the loan agent demands more money. If the user does not repay the demanded money, abusive messages/images of the user will be sent to all the contacts in the users device. There are many reports of users taking their own life as they were unable to withstand the harassment. And the more saddening part is that some of these apps are still available in Google Play Store."
