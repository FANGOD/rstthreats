                        "So far, we saw two packages, still available, with clear connections to the original malicious junkeldat package. But now, things start to get more interesting.",
                        "These unique strings from one malicious package relates to 3 packages (active at the time of our research), two of them are in other package managers:",
                        "All of the packages in this blog are related to the same attacker and to a malicious package known to the community for several years. Looking at this single package and applying advanced hunting techniques helps us demonstrate that the attacks are not language-specific -- a fact that amplifies the need for cross-industry communication and information sharing.",
                        "One hunting technique that can be translated to the field of OSS security involves searching for reappearances of various Indications of Compromise (IOCs) in other places as a sign of malicious activity.",
                        "The lack of communication and information sharing inside the open source ecosystem enables these packages to go undetected for long periods of time, We think that a formal central repository of malicious packages containing samples from different programming languages is crucial to detect those attackers and we are working with various parties make this happen and keep the open source ecosystem safe and clean.",
                        "The setup.py file of the malicious junkeldat package included the following snippet:",
                        "To be able to identify these threats at scale we automated this process and are using multiple data points to try and find relations between known malicious activity and yet-to-be-discovered ones using our hunting engine.",
                        "Aside from the malicious functionality, which depending on the dropped file can be practically anything, the attacker also used (what seems to be) a misleading tactic to make it harder for analysts to investigate the code, and as a result, waste their time. The rest of the files in the package are organized in a nested directory tree with nonsense file names.",
                        "Putting it simply, this code returns the IP address of a given hostnamein this case, www[.]dl01[.]pwnz[.]org encoded to base64. This package, which had been flagged as malicious back in 2018, was removed from PyPI.",
                        "Widespread use of open source software has motivated malicious actors to take advantage of the medium, spawning significant and widespread attacks.",
                        "During an analysis we performed of one of the more famous datasets of open-source malicious codethe Backstabbers Knife Collection, we came across a PyPI package called Junkeldat",
                        "Starting with the somsomsom code package (still available on PyPI today), we found it resembles the junkeldat in structure but contains no malicious parts. However, it does have a clear connection to our starting point package: the home page field in the metadata, also directing to hxxp://pypi.python[.]org/pypi/junkeldat/",
                        "Malicious packages in multiple programming languages that went undetected for years were revealed by the Checkmarx Supply Chain Security team using advanced threat hunting techniques.",
                        "This data allows us to create clusters based on the relations we find, which many times include relations across several package managers. One of the uses of this is our ability to reveal new suspicious packages through their association to a package that is a known malicious one. The following research illustrates this process perfectly."
