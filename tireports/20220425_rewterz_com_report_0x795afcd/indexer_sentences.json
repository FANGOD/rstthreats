This RAT was originally promoted as genuine software for remote control of Microsoft Windows from XP onwards, and is frequently found in phishing attempts due to its capacity to completely infect an afflicted machine. Remcos malware attacks Windows systems and provides the attacker complete control over the machine.It is frequently distributed by malicious documents or archive files that contain scripts or executables. Remcos, like other RATs, offers the threat actor complete access over the infected PCs which allow them to record keystrokes, passwords, and other critical information. Remcos incorporates various obfuscation and anti-debugging techniques to evade detection. Regular updates of its features by its creators make this malware a challenging adversary."}
