The loaded malicious DLL creates a malicious VBE file in the %TEMP% folder and runs it. Figures 4 to 6 show a part of the decoded VBE code. The decoded VBE is ReVBShell. It can access C2 to perform various malicious behaviors depending on the command. It also obtains information about the anti-malware installed on the PC through the WMI query.
