                        "The 3 files all go through the same process of running the internal data after decoding it. The decoded data fulfill different purposes for each file. It appears HimTraylcon.exe is downloaded in the following URL through ReVBShell.",
                        "When the malicious command is executed through the Click() function, it decompiles the CHM file and runs the ImagingDevices.exe file. ImagingDevices.exe is a normal file, but it loads the malicious DLL that was also decompiled using the DLL hijacking method. Looking at the malicious CHM files of the same type that were distributed last year shows that they first loaded quartz.dll from Vias.exe (later changed to load LBTServ.dll from LBTWiz32.exe). The loaded malicious DLL creates a malicious VBE file in the %TEMP% folder and runs it. Figures 4 to 6 show a part of the decoded VBE code. The decoded VBE is ReVBShell. It can access C2 to perform various malicious behaviors depending on the command. It also obtains information about the anti-malware installed on the PC through the WMI query. If the ESET Security string exists, it will not perform malicious behaviors.",
                        "AhnLabs ASD infrastructure discovered a log that creates and runs additional malicious files by the attacker after ReVBShell is run and a certain time has passed. The names of the additional malicious files discovered are shown below. You can see that they are disguised as document editing and messenger programs used by many Korean users."

Looking at the malicious CHM files of the same type that were distributed last year shows that they first loaded quartz.dll from Vias.exe (later changed to load LBTServ.dll from LBTWiz32.exe). The loaded malicious DLL creates a malicious VBE file in the %TEMP% folder and runs it. Figures 4 to 6 show a part of the decoded VBE code. The decoded VBE is ReVBShell. It can access C2 to perform various malicious behaviors depending on the command. It also obtains information about the anti-malware installed on the PC through the WMI query.

Looking at the malicious CHM files of the same type that were distributed last year shows that they first loaded quartz.dll from Vias.exe (later changed to load LBTServ.dll from LBTWiz32.exe). The loaded malicious DLL creates a malicious VBE file in the %TEMP% folder and runs it. Figures 4 to 6 show a part of the decoded VBE code. The decoded VBE is ReVBShell. It can access C2 to perform various malicious behaviors depending on the command. It also obtains information about the anti-malware installed on the PC through the WMI query. If the ESET Security string exists, it will not perform malicious behaviors."
