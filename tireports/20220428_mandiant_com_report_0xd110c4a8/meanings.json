                        "To gain access to a victim environment, APT29 sent spear-phishing emails disguised as embassy administrative updates. These phishing emails used legitimate, but compromised email addresses from other diplomatic entities. APT29 targeted large lists of recipients that Mandiant suspected were primarily publicly listed points of contact of embassy personnel. These phishing emails utilized a malicious HTML dropper tracked as ROOTSAW, that makes use of a technique known as HTML smuggling to deliver an IMG or ISO file to a victim system.",
                        "APT29 is a Russian espionage group that Mandiant has been tracking since at least 2014 and is likely sponsored by the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). The diplomatic-centric targeting of this recent activity is consistent with Russian strategic priorities as well as historic APT29 targeting. Mandiant previously tracked this intrusion activity under multiple clusters, UNC2652 and UNC2542, which were recently merged into APT29 in April 2022. Some APT29 activity is also publicly referred to as Nobelium by Microsoft.",
                        "APT29 was also observed exploiting misconfigured certificate templates to allow them to impersonate admin users. From here, APT29 created additional malicious certificates which they used to move laterally within the environment. This recent technique, which is well documented in a report from SpecterOps and was presented at Blackhat in August 2021, gives the attacker the ability to quickly escalate their privileges within the environment, but also provides a method for long term persistence through the creation of malicious certificates.",
                        "Mandiant anticipates sustained waves of phishing activity by APT29 that employ novel tools and infrastructure to hinder detection. While these campaigns are likely to be directed against diplomatic missions and foreign policy information as part of the groups mandate to support Russian strategic interests, the invasion of Ukraine and heightened tensions between the West, Europe, and Russia are likely to influence the intensity and urgency of collection operations.",
                        "Once the host id has been created, BOOMMIC passes this value to the function used to download and execute payloads to be used as part of the request. BOOMMIC then sends a GET request to its C2 to download and execute a shellcode payload. Mandiant observed APT29 leveraging compromised websites as the C2 for BOOMMIC. Once a payload is successfully downloaded, BOOMMIC XOR decodes and then executes it in memory.",
                        "BEATDROP is an ideal example of APT29s continued efforts to obfuscate its activity and maintain persistent access. Following multiple waves of phishing utilizing BEATDROP to target diplomatic entities, Mandiant along with other researchers identified APT29 moving away from BEATDROP to a novel C++ BEACON loader in their latest campaigns against diplomatic entities. Several scenarios could explain this shift in tooling including the possibility that BEATDROP was no longer providing value to the group in terms of capability, or reflective of operational TTPs to periodically retool for the purposes of evading detection.",
                        "Prior to executing BOOMMIC APT29 was observed creating persistence via a registry key for Java Update that would execute jucheck.exe from the directory that contained version.dll and the BOOMMIC payload.",
                        "APT29 was then observed utilizing the impersonation of a privileged user to copy SharedReality.dll to the Temp directory of multiple systems. The group then deployed it via a scheduled task named SharedRealitySvcDLC which was installed and executed. After executing the scheduled task, the task was then immediately deleted.",
                        "One notable TTP observed by APT29 was the hunting for passwords stored in SYSVOL. This technique relies on passwords that are stored as part of Group Policy Preferences. Passwords stored in this way are encrypted using a known scheme that can easily be decrypted. Microsoft fixed this in MS14-025 which removed the option of configuring Group Policy Preferences with the cpassword. While the patch was issued in 2014 it is still possible to come across systems with passwords stored in Group Policy Preferences, either due to the patch never having been applied or because the patch does not remove existing Group Policy Preferences that contain passwords (as Microsoft does not risk breaking existing functionality).",
                        "The phishing emails sent by APT29 masqueraded as administrative notices related to various embassies and utilized legitimate but co-opted email addresses to send emails and Atlassian's Trello service for command and control (C2). These phishing emails were similar to previous Nobelium phishing campaigns in 2021 as they targeted diplomatic organizations, used ROOTSAW (publicly known as EnvyScout) to deliver additional payloads, and misused Firebase or DropBox for C2. The misuse of legitimate webservices such as Trello, Firebase, or DropBox is likely an attempt to make detection or remediation harder.",
                        "Mandiant observed APT29 quickly move to escalate their privileges within domains once access was established. In multiple cases, APT29 was able to gain Domain Admin in less than 12 hours from the initial phishing payloads execution. APT29 was observed utilizing a variety of TTPs to escalate their privileges. In one instance, APT29 was observed writing files that contained Kerberos tickets most likely to be used in Pass the Ticket attacks or for offline cracking.",
                        "Mandiant observed APT29 quickly moving laterally within an environment. To facilitate lateral movement APT29 relied on a combination of malicious certificates used for impersonation of privileged users and SMB BEACON.",
                        "APT29 then executed jucheck.exe via wmic which then loaded and executed BOOMMIC based on DLL Side Loading.",
                        "APT29 was also observed by Mandiant using nltest to enumerate Domain Controllers on the domain:",
                        "Since early 2021, Mandiant has been tracking extensive APT29 phishing campaigns targeting diplomatic organizations in Europe, the Americas, and Asia. This blog post discusses our recent observations related to the identification of two new malware families in 2022, BEATDROP and BOOMMIC, as well as APT29s efforts to evade detection through retooling and abuse of Atlassian's Trello service.",
                        "The totality of the TTPs used by APT29 supports the assessment that APT29's goal in these campaigns is to establish multiple means of long-term access to facilitate intelligence collection for espionage purposes within the targeted diplomatic entities victim networks.",
                        "A brief overview of the technique as used by APT29 in actual compromises that Mandiant investigated follows.",
                        "One of the first commands employed by the group was the windows net command. APT29 was observed using the net command widely to enumerate users and groups.",
                        "The LNK utilized by APT29 in the early waves of this campaign shared multiple characteristics with those identified in campaigns from 2021, including the use of a specific icon location, as well as the machine ID and MAC address. One technique observed being used by APT29 was using LNK file extensions that have a different icon than the target application or document, making the shortcut appear as a document rather than a program to launch. This tricks the victim into opening a seemingly legitimate document. Shortcut files by default also have their LNK file extension hidden, even if the Windows Explorer show file extensions is enabled, further lowering any suspicion a shortcut instead of a document is opened.",
                        "APT29 was first observed moving laterally after the group was seen staging and deploying SMB BEACON to multiple systems. To facilitate the staging of BEACON on remote systems APT29 utilized a malicious certificate that allowed the group to impersonate a privileged user. The first evidence of SMB BEACON being deployed was seen through the local staging of a zip file shortly following the successful execution of BOOMMIC.",
                        "Figure 3: Example APT29 Phishing Lure, with an attached file Covid.html",
                        "Once APT29 established access, Mandiant observed the group performing extensive reconnaissance of hosts and the Active Directory environment. The group was also observed conducting on-host reconnaissance looking for credentials.",
                        "As previously noted, Mandiant has observed the group widely using scheduled tasks, run keys, malicious certificates, and in-memory backdoors, in some cases multiple per system. The use of these techniques and tools represents the multiple means by which APT29 attempts to maintain access within an environment. This is further supported by the activity identified by Mandiant that saw APT29 writing zip files that contained Kerberos tickets as well as the creation and most likely exportation of malicious certificates.",
                        "AD CS will enable the setup of Certificate Templates that are used when generating new certificates. The particular misconfiguration abused by APT29, referenced by SpecterOps as ESC1, allows low-privileged users to escalate directly to Domain Admin. Related to this specific case of abuse, three distinct settings on a certificate template are important:",
                        "Following the successful deployment of BEATDROP to deliver and execute a payload, APT29 was observed leveraging BOOMMIC to further establish a foothold within the environment. BOOMMIC, also known as VaporRage by Microsoft, is a shellcode downloader written in C that communicates over HTTP to co-opted infrastructure used for C2. APT29 executed BOOMMIC through DLL Side Loading of a modified version.dll by a legitimate Java binary, jucheck.exe.",
                        "Mandiant also identified APT29 utilizing a malicious docx to deliver an HTA dropper, resulting in the delivery and execution of BEATDROP on a target system, in a separate but similar phishing campaign.",
                        "APT29 first deployed BOOMMIC within minutes following the successful execution of BEATDROP. The group deployed the malicious BOOMMIC DLL javafx_font.dll (363a95777f401df40db61148593ea387) alongside two additional files:",
                        "An operational shift was observed in February 2022 when APT29 moved from deploying BEATDROP, which used a third-party cloud service to retrieve BEACON, to a simpler BEACON dropper that relied on co-opted infrastructure. The subsequent sections will highlight the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures as well as the tooling used by APT29 in their latest phishing campaigns.",
                        "Beginning mid-January 2022, Mandiant detected and responded to an APT29 phishing campaign targeting a diplomatic entity. During the investigation, Mandiant identified the deployment and use of the BEATDROP and BOOMMIC downloaders. Shortly following the identification of this campaign, Mandiant discovered APT29 targeting multiple additional diplomatic and government entities through a series of phishing waves.",
                        "This latest wave of spear phishing showcases APT29s enduring interests in obtaining diplomatic and foreign policy information from governments around the world. The shift away from BEATDROP to BEACON further highlights the groups efforts to vary its TTPs and alter BEACON delivery mechanisms via spear phishing campaigns that follow a notable pattern.",

These phishing emails were similar to previous Nobelium phishing campaigns in 2021 as they targeted diplomatic organizations, used ROOTSAW (publicly known as EnvyScout) to deliver additional payloads, and misused Firebase or DropBox for C2. The misuse of legitimate webservices such as Trello, Firebase, or DropBox is likely an attempt to make detection or remediation harder.",

The diplomatic-centric targeting of this recent activity is consistent with Russian strategic priorities as well as historic APT29 targeting. Mandiant previously tracked this intrusion activity under multiple clusters, UNC2652 and UNC2542, which were recently merged into APT29 in April 2022. Some APT29 activity is also publicly referred to as Nobelium by Microsoft."

APT29 targeted large lists of recipients that Mandiant suspected were primarily publicly listed points of contact of embassy personnel. These phishing emails utilized a malicious HTML dropper tracked as ROOTSAW, that makes use of a technique known as HTML smuggling to deliver an IMG or ISO file to a victim system.",

The subsequent sections will highlight the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures as well as the tooling used by APT29 in their latest phishing campaigns.",

These phishing emails were similar to previous Nobelium phishing campaigns in 2021 as they targeted diplomatic organizations, used ROOTSAW (publicly known as EnvyScout) to deliver additional payloads, and misused Firebase or DropBox for C2. The misuse of legitimate webservices such as Trello, Firebase, or DropBox is likely an attempt to make detection or remediation harder.",

In multiple cases, APT29 was able to gain Domain Admin in less than 12 hours from the initial phishing payloads execution. APT29 was observed utilizing a variety of TTPs to escalate their privileges. In one instance, APT29 was observed writing files that contained Kerberos tickets most likely to be used in Pass the Ticket attacks or for offline cracking.",

During the investigation, Mandiant identified the deployment and use of the BEATDROP and BOOMMIC downloaders. Shortly following the identification of this campaign, Mandiant discovered APT29 targeting multiple additional diplomatic and government entities through a series of phishing waves.",

Following multiple waves of phishing utilizing BEATDROP to target diplomatic entities, Mandiant along with other researchers identified APT29 moving away from BEATDROP to a novel C++ BEACON loader in their latest campaigns against diplomatic entities. Several scenarios could explain this shift in tooling including the possibility that BEATDROP was no longer providing value to the group in terms of capability, or reflective of operational TTPs to periodically retool for the purposes of evading detection.",

One technique observed being used by APT29 was using LNK file extensions that have a different icon than the target application or document, making the shortcut appear as a document rather than a program to launch. This tricks the victim into opening a seemingly legitimate document. Shortcut files by default also have their LNK file extension hidden, even if the Windows Explorer show file extensions is enabled, further lowering any suspicion a shortcut instead of a document is opened.",
