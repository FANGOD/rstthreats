When manually executed by the victim, the fake setup process initializes the NetSupportManager RAT (remote access tool) and the legitimate Chrome setup as a decoy (Figure 1). NetSupportManager is commonly used to remotely control systems for malicious purposes.A shortcut is also added to the users startup directory for persistence. Figure 1 Endpoint view of NetSupportManager execution and decoy payload. Using the NetSupportManager RAT session, the threat actor copied obfuscated scripts with a .wmd extension that are responsible for creating a renamed AutoIT binary and an loading an obfuscated version of Mars Stealer from %TEMP%/IXP<3-digit number> .TMP. One of the obfuscated scripts contains an embedded payload encrypted with RC4 using the hardcoded key 344868553478223918282826525 (Figure 2).Figure 2 Snippets from AutoIT script showing embedded payload and decryption routine. Once loaded, Mars Stealer performs several HTTP requests to retrieve configuration and DLL (Dynamic Link Library) files required for Mars Stealer to operate successfully and upload stolen data (Figure 3).Figure 3 Mars Stealer network communications.
