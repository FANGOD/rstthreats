            "text": "The geopolitical crisis between Russia and Ukraine has fueled multiple cyberattacks across the world. While monitoring for the latest cyber incidents that are part of the ongoing cyber warfare, the Cyble Research Labs recently came across a ransomware sample allegedly targeting Russia. Whats interesting is that instead of demanding ransom, this ransomware sends out a message to stop the war.\nUpon execution, the ransomware renames encrypted files with the .putinwillburnunhell extension. While typically ransomware drops a .txt file as a ransom note, in this case, we saw a .html file named RUSSKIJ VOENNIJ KORABL IDI NAHUJ, which when translated in English means RUSSIAN WARSHIP GO F**K.\nOur Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) analysis shows that Poland is the source of the sample. The message in the HTML file indicates that the ransomware may be targeting Russia, as shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1 Message in a Dropped file (Translated from Russian)"

            "text": "Cyble Research Labs performed an analysis of the sample with the hash value: 9f3c1668ee44bfcd1afd599215f5bd73c76609776b78cb04bb6ef1121cc80d37. Our research indicated that the malware is an x64 architecture Windows binary written in C/C++ and compiled on 2022-03-04 at 15:17:53.\nFigure 2 File Information\nWe observed that the malware first changes the priority of the process to zero by calling the SetProcessShutdownParameters() API so that the malwares activities can be terminated only before the system shutdown. This is a way to increase the amount of time the malware gets to execute in the compromised machine.\nFigure 3 Malware Changes the Priority of the Process\nThe ransomware enumerates services in the compromised system and terminates those services that are actively running in the victims machine. Some of these services include VSS, SQL, Memtas, mepocs, etc.\nTo identify the services in the victims machine, it calls the OpenSCManagerA() API, which establishes a connection to the service control manager and gives the malware access to the service control manager database, as shown in Figure 4.\nFigure 4 Establishes a Connection to the Service Control Manager\nThe ransomware also enumerates the running processes and terminates processes that are actively running in the victims machine. The process names checked by the ransomware include oracle.exe, ocssd.exe, dbsnmp.exe, synctime.exe, etc.\nFigure 5 Terminates Active Processes\nThe malware calls the SHEmptyRecycleBinA() API to empty the Recycle Bin as a step to ensure that deleted files cannot be restored after encryption.\nOur research indicated that the ransomware tries to open a mutex named Microsoft Corporation in an infected machine. If the mutex name is not present, the malware creates the same mutex name and continues with its infection process.\nFigure 6 Checks and Creates Mutex if not Present\nAfter creating the mutex, the malware then begins the encryption process by identifying the volumes in an infected machine.\nFigure 7 Starts Encryption\nIt also identifies the mounted local drives by enumerating them from A to Z, as shown in Figure 8.\nFigure 8 Enumerates Local Drives\nThis is followed by the malware encrypting the files present in all of the identified drives with the exception of CD-ROM, as shown in Figure 9.\nFigure 9 Encrypts the Files present in all the Identified Drives Except CD-ROM\nBefore initiating encryption, the ransomware checks and excludes specific folders from encryption, such as AppData, Boot, Windows, Windows.old, Tor Browser, Internet Explorer, Google, Opera, Opera Software, Mozilla, Mozilla Firefox, ProgramData, Program Files, and Program Files (x86).\nIt also excludes certain files from encryption, such as autorun.inf, boot.ini, bootfont.bin, bootsect.bak, bootmgr, bootmgr.efi, bootmgfw.efi, desktop.ini, iconcache.db, ntldr, and ntuser.dat.\nAdditionally, specific extensions are also exempted from encryption, including .putinwillburninhell, .hta, .exe, .dll, .cpl, .ini, .cab, .cur, .drv, .hlp, .icl, .icns, .ico, .idx, .sys, .spl, .ocx.\nAfter encrypting the files on the victims machine, the malware appends them with the extension .putinwillburninhell and drops an HTML file with the name RUSSKIJ VOENNIJ KORABL IDI NAHUJ as shown in Figure 10.\nFigure 10 Encrypted Files on the Victims Machine"

As a result of the ongoing cyber warfare, we have witnessed an uptick in the use of ransomware and data wiper malware targeting both nations in conflict. Threat Actors are also devising attack techniques of increasing sophistication.\nWith cybercrime on the rise, it is imperative for organizations to strengthen their security posture. Our researchers are continuously gathering more information on the latest cyberattacks, and we will keep updating this space as and when we have more information."
