Our analysis provides a unique and holistic view of Winnti operational aspects, capabilities and modus operandi. While some of the tools mentioned in the research were previously reported on, some tools such as DEPLOYLOG were previously undocumented and first analyzed in this report. In addition, our analysis provides further insights regarding some of the known Winnti tools."}

The malware authors chose to break the infection chain into multiple interdependent phases, where each phase relies on the previous one in order to execute correctly. This demonstrates the thought and effort that was put into both the malware and operational security considerations, making it almost impossible to analyze unless all pieces of the puzzle are assembled in the correct order."}
