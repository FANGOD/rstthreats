                        "While typical Chaos ransomware variants provide at least some hope to the victim that files smaller than 2,117,152 bytes that were encrypted might be recovered upon ransom payment, this particular variant provides no such avenue as the attacker has no intent on providing a decryption tool. Combining that with the deletion of shadow copies from the compromised machine, which inhibits file recovery, makes it awfully difficult for non-tech savvy victims to recover their affected files.",
                        "The Chaos ransomware variant that this blog covers is unique in the sense that the attacker has no intention of providing a decryption tool or file recovery instructions for its victims to recover their affected files. Finding them is a tall order for non-technical victims, which pretty much makes the malware a file destroyer. Clearly, the motive behind this malware is destruction. The politically inclined messages also indicate that the attacker is pro-Russian and frustrated with the current situation. And with the Chaos ransomware builder now readily available, its options allow anyone to create destructive malware. And with no end to the war in sight, FortiGuard Labs expects more malware like this to emerge.",
                        "A GUI-based Chaos ransomware builder is known to be available that can easily customize the malware according to a set of options. FortiGuard Labs recently discovered a sample of malware that seems to have been created using this builder. Unfortunately, how the malware arrives on a victims machine is unknown. However, given the political stance of the malware (the blog will cover this later), the malware likely arrives either via forum posts or emails focused on the current Russia-Ukraine war.",
                        "Its malware activities are typical of recent Chaos ransomware variants. Like most ransomware, it displays a message in stop_propaganda.txt. However, things get a bit interesting from here as it displays the following message:",
                        "In this vein, FortiGuard Labs recently came across a variant of the Chaos ransomware that appears to side with Russia. This blog explains the vicious consequences that the Chaos variant delivers to a compromised machine."

Fear spread quickly as many organizations around the globe had been victimized by the Conti group in the past, with stolen data exposed and critical files being encrypted. However, the Conti group was bitten back soon after the announcement was made. An allegedly unhappy Conti insider took the matter in their hands and leaked Contis internal chat logs to the public."

Fear spread quickly as many organizations around the globe had been victimized by the Conti group in the past, with stolen data exposed and critical files being encrypted. However, the Conti group was bitten back soon after the announcement was made. An allegedly unhappy Conti insider took the matter in their hands and leaked Contis internal chat logs to the public.",

Combining that with the deletion of shadow copies from the compromised machine, which inhibits file recovery, makes it awfully difficult for non-tech savvy victims to recover their affected files.",

Finding them is a tall order for non-technical victims, which pretty much makes the malware a file destroyer. Clearly, the motive behind this malware is destruction. The politically inclined messages also indicate that the attacker is pro-Russian and frustrated with the current situation. And with the Chaos ransomware builder now readily available, its options allow anyone to create destructive malware. And with no end to the war in sight, FortiGuard Labs expects more malware like this to emerge.",

FortiGuard Labs recently discovered a sample of malware that seems to have been created using this builder. Unfortunately, how the malware arrives on a victims machine is unknown. However, given the political stance of the malware (the blog will cover this later), the malware likely arrives either via forum posts or emails focused on the current Russia-Ukraine war.",

Finding them is a tall order for non-technical victims, which pretty much makes the malware a file destroyer. Clearly, the motive behind this malware is destruction. The politically inclined messages also indicate that the attacker is pro-Russian and frustrated with the current situation. And with the Chaos ransomware builder now readily available, its options allow anyone to create destructive malware.

Each encrypted file contains an RSA encrypted password with a hardcoded public key + base64 encoded AES encrypted file content. The malware also adds a fuckazov file extension to the affected files.

Each encrypted file contains an RSA encrypted password with a hardcoded public key + base64 encoded AES encrypted file content. The malware also adds a fuckazov file extension to the affected files. Figure 1 shows the content of an encrypted file. azov may be a reference to the Azov Battalion who put up a fierce fight against Russian military forces in the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, Ukraine."
