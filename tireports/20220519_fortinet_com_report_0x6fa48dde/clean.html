<p>Since the beginning of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine War, some ransomware and hacking groups have publicly declared which side they are on. Such actions have created tension internally within the threat actor groups as it has caused dissension, and externally, as organizations fear being targeted due to the political nature of the war.</p>
<p>One notable example is the Conti RaaS (Ransomware-as-a-Service) that officially announced in February 2022 that they are backing Russia and would use their arsenal against critical infrastructures that belong to the West. Fear spread quickly as many organizations around the globe had been victimized by the Conti group in the past, with stolen data exposed and critical files being encrypted. However, the Conti group was bitten back soon after the announcement was made. An allegedly unhappy Conti insider took the matter in their hands and leaked Conti’s internal chat logs to the public.</p>
<p>On the other side of the debate, the LockBit ransomware group made it clear that they will not involve themselves in the political war because of the multinational nature of its developers and affiliates.</p>
<p>In this vein, FortiGuard Labs recently came across a variant of the Chaos ransomware that appears to side with Russia. This blog explains the vicious consequences that the Chaos variant delivers to a compromised machine.</p>
<p>Affected Platforms: Windows
Impacted Parties: Windows users
Impact: Potential loss of files
Severity Level: Medium
</p>
<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<p>A GUI-based Chaos ransomware builder is known to be available that can easily customize the malware according to a set of options. FortiGuard Labs recently discovered a sample of malware that seems to have been created using this builder. Unfortunately, how the malware arrives on a victim’s machine is unknown. However, given the political stance of the malware (the blog will cover this later), the malware likely arrives either via forum posts or emails focused on the current Russia-Ukraine war.</p>
<p>Once the malware runs, it enumerates the files on all drives. For files smaller than 2,117,152 bytes, it generates a random 20-character long password for each file and then encrypts it with AES-256 (CBC-SALTED). Each encrypted file contains an RSA encrypted password with a hardcoded public key + base64 encoded AES encrypted file content. The malware also adds a ‘fuckazov’ file extension to the affected files. Figure 1 shows the content of an encrypted file. “azov” may be a reference to the Azov Battalion who put up a fierce fight against Russian military forces in the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, Ukraine.</p>

Figure 1. Content of an encrypted file
<p>For files larger than 2,117,152 bytes, the malware fills them with random bytes, making file recovery impossible without backup. The affected files also have 'fuckazov’ as a file extension.</p>
<p>For the C: drive, the malware searches for files in the following directories and either encrypts or fills them with random data depending on the file size and adds a ‘fuckazov’ file extension.</p>
<p>"\\Desktop"; "\\Links"; "\\Contacts"; "\\Desktop"; "\\Documents"; "\\Downloads"; "\\Pictures"; "\\Music"; "\\OneDrive"; "\\Saved Games"; "\\Favorites"; "\\Searches"; \\Videos.</p>
<p>Its malware activities are typical of recent Chaos ransomware variants. Like most ransomware, it displays a message in “stop_propaganda.txt”. However, things get a bit interesting from here as it displays the following message:</p>
<p>Stop Ukraine War! F**k Zelensky! Dont go die for f**king clown! 
 You can see the truth here:

Figure 2. Message displayed by the malware
<p>As seen in Figure 2, there is no ransom demand nor any information on how the victim can reach out to the attacker. The links on the message leads to a Russian Web page, created in April 2022, with what appears to be political messages and information:</p>
<img alt="Screenshot of the Web page linked in the message displayed by the malware" class="loading" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="max-width:80%;height:auto;width:auto;"/>
Figure 3. Screenshot of the Web page linked in the message displayed by the malware
<p>The message reads in English:</p>
<p>“- Victory will be ours!</p>
<p>Information and Coordination Center”</p>

Figure 4. Description of the Web site
<p>Machine translation into English is as follows:</p>

<p>The Web site also appears to include a list of Ukrainian soldiers who were either killed in combat or who are considered war criminals in the eyes of the Russian Armed Forces.</p>
<p>While typical Chaos ransomware variants provide at least some hope to the victim that files smaller than 2,117,152 bytes that were encrypted might be recovered upon ransom payment, this particular variant provides no such avenue as the attacker has no intent on providing a decryption tool. Combining that with the deletion of shadow copies from the compromised machine, which inhibits file recovery, makes it awfully difficult for non-tech savvy victims to recover their affected files.</p>
<p>The malware appears to be fresh as it was likely compiled on May 16th, 2022, for this attack.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Chaos ransomware variant that this blog covers is unique in the sense that the attacker has no intention of providing a decryption tool or file recovery instructions for its victims to recover their affected files. Finding them is a tall order for non-technical victims, which pretty much makes the malware a file destroyer. Clearly, the motive behind this malware is “destruction.” The politically inclined messages also indicate that the attacker is pro-Russian and frustrated with the current situation. And with the Chaos ransomware builder now readily available, its options allow anyone to create destructive malware. And with no end to the war in sight, FortiGuard Labs expects more malware like this to emerge.</p>
<p>Victims of ransomware are cautioned against paying ransoms by such organizations as CISA, NCSC, the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/ransomware" target="_blank" title="https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/ransomware">FBI</a>, and HHS. Payment does not guarantee files will be recovered. It may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities which could potentially be illegal according to a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_advisory_10012020_1.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_advisory_10012020_1.pdf">U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)</a> advisory.
