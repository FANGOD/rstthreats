                        "Due to the reboot mode change performed by the ransomware earlier, the PC will reboot in safe mode with the Fax service running. This service will then execute the ransomware again, but this time for the purpose of encryption. As most ransomwares these days, Black Basta first enumerates volumes and puts a readme.txt file, a surprisingly short ransom note (maybe because the initial presentation is done in the desktop wallpaper) containing a data publication threat, TOR website address of the gang, and a company ID. This note is written to every folder as a part of the encryption routine.",
                        "Black Basta begins by checking if any parameters were passed. The only parameter that this ransomware accepts is -forcepath, which we assume that if passed, will encrypt files in the specific path only. However, in dynamic analysis selecting a specific path, no differences in encryption routine were observed. Next, the ransomware deletes shadow copies by executing C:\\Windows\\SysNative\\vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet command.",
                        "The Black Basta ransomware was first observed in mid-April 2022, but had already caused substantial damage to over ten organizations. This new ransomware became more public after leaking data of the American Dental Association, from which the Black Basta gang was able to exfiltrate 2.9 GB of data.",
                        "Now come the interesting part - the persistence mechanism of the Black Basta ransomware is implemented by stealing an existing service name, deleting the service, and then creating a new service with the same(stolen) name. In our sample, the legitimate service whose name was stolen is FAX:",
                        "This article focuses only on the final stages of the Black Basta ransomware, that occurs only after the attacker has achieved initial access and has managed to perform substantial lateral movement within the network. Minervas Anti-Ransomware solution recognizes attempts to bypass security measures in order to remain undetected, and uses these very methods to prevent them from ever starting the attack.",
                        "Black Basta ransomware must be executed with Administrator privileges, otherwise this ransomware is harmless.",
                        "Black basta drops two files: dlaksjdoiwq.jpg and fkdjsadasd.ico in the user Temp folder. dlaksjdoiwq.jpg is a desktop wallpaper, pointing to read a ransom note, that is set by the ransomware using the SystemParametersInfoW API call:",

This note is written to every folder as a part of the encryption routine.",
