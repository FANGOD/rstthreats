This is performed by setting the registry values under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon to the following:",
                        "Conti also updated the encrypted file extensions to include uppercase and lowercase characters and numbers. The following file extension examples have been observed in recent Conti samples:",
                        "Win64.Ransom.Conti",
                        "After Conti has completed file encryption in Safe Mode, it executes the command bcedit.exe /deletevalue {current} safeboot and reboots the system. Conti's file encryption algorithms remain the same as previous versions with a per file random 256-bit ChaCha symmetric key. Each file's ChaCha key is protected by a hardcoded victim-specific 4,096-bit RSA public key.",
                        "The latest Conti portal contains a landing page that instructs the user to follow the instructions in the README.txt file that is written to disk after file encryption. It no longer supports a victim uploading the ransom note to authenticate as shown in Figure 4.",
                        "In late January 2022, ThreatLabz identified an updated version of Conti ransomware as part of the global ransomware tracking efforts. This update was released prior to the massive leak of Conti source code and chat logs on Februrary 27, 2022. The leaks were published by a Ukrainian researcher after the invasion of Ukraine. However, since these leaks were published, the Conti gang has continued to attack organizations and conduct business as usual. While two versions of Conti source code have been leaked, the most recent ransomware code has not yet been leaked. This blog will highlight the most recent changes to the ransomware and how Conti improved file encryption, introduced techniques to better evade security software, and streamlined the ransom payment process.",
                        "The new Conti ransom note is streamlined with a direct link to a victim-specific chat portal. Prior versions required a victim to access the portal and then upload their ransom note, which contained a unique identifier.",
                        "The functionality for the command-line arguments -log and -nomutex was removed. The new command-line parameters that were added are related to features that enable Conti to reboot the system in Windows Safe Mode with networking enabled and then start file encryption. By booting in Safe Mode, Conti can maximize the number of files that are encrypted, because business applications such as databases are likely not running. Therefore, those applications will not have open file handles that could prevent file encryption. In addition, many security software applications (e.g., antivirus programs) will not be loaded by default when the system is running in Safe Mode. The ability to encrypt files in Windows Safe Mode is a feature that has been observed in other ransomware families including REvil and BlackMatter.",
                        "In order to hinder malware analysis, Conti dynamically resolves most Windows API functions by using a hash algorithm. In the previous version of Conti, the hash algorithm was Murmur2, while the latest version now uses Murmur3. This produces different hash values for all API functions that are used by Conti, which may evade security software that searches for the corresponding hash values.",
                        "The most recent Conti update introduced a number of new features and changes to the ransomware code. Some of these modifications include new command-line arguments that are highlighted in bold in Table 1.",
                        "The new Conti update also added the ability to change desktop wallpaper by writing an embedded PNG file to C:\\ProgramData\\conti.png. An example of the Conti wallpaper image is shown in Figure 3.",
                        "Conti then executes the command bcedit.exe /set {current} safeboot network and forces a system reboot by calling the Windows API function ExitWindowsEx(). This will launch Windows in Safe Mode with networking enabled as shown in Figure 2. The network mode is enabled, so that Conti can still be used to encrypt files on network shares.",

Despite the group's source code and chat logs being leaked online in February 2022, Conti continues to conduct ransomware attacks against large organizations. ThreatLabz expects the Conti gang to further update the malware and potentially rebrand as the source code leaks have damaged their reputation and may lead to other criminal groups forking the code.",

However, since these leaks were published, the Conti gang has continued to attack organizations and conduct business as usual. While two versions of Conti source code have been leaked, the most recent ransomware code has not yet been leaked. This blog will highlight the most recent changes to the ransomware and how Conti improved file encryption, introduced techniques to better evade security software, and streamlined the ransom payment process.",

Despite the group's source code and chat logs being leaked online in February 2022, Conti continues to conduct ransomware attacks against large organizations. ThreatLabz expects the Conti gang to further update the malware and potentially rebrand as the source code leaks have damaged their reputation and may lead to other criminal groups forking the code.",
