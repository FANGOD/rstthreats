A listing of PrivateLoaders decrypted strings for the loader component can be found here and the main components decrypted strings can be found here.",
                        "The PrivateLoader main component creates a URL by combining the C2 address passed in from the loader with the path /base/api/getData.php. The malware then sends HTTP POST requests containing a command and various data. An example PrivateLoader main components request and response is similar to Figure 3.",
                        "PrivateLoader is a typical downloader malware family that provides a PPI service that has gained traction as a viable malware distribution method for multiple threat actors. PrivateLoader is currently used to distribute ransomware, stealer, banker, and other commodity malware. The loader will likely continue to be updated with new features and functionality to evade detection and effectively deliver second-stage malware payloads.",
                        "The wallet and/or saved login data themselves arent exfiltrated, rather PrivateLoader just checks for the existence of them. This data is likely used to help determine follow-on payloads such as stealer or banking malware that can make better use of the credentials.",

The first two dead drop resolver URLs return a plaintext response, while the third dead drop resolver returns a response that is XOR encrypted with a one-byte key (e.g., 0x6d). PrivateLoader expects the (decrypted) response to be in the format HOST:<IP_Address>. An example dead drop resolver response is the following:",

Intel 471 and Walmart reported on PrivateLoaders pay-per-install (PPI) service that distributes malware on behalf of other threat actors. The malware payloads can be selectively delivered to victims based on certain criteria (e.g. location, cryptocurrency or financial activity, on a corporate network, specific software installed, etc.) As previously reported, some of the payloads being distributed include Redline Stealer, Vidar Stealer, SmokeLoader, Stop ransomware, and other commodity malware.",

The C2 address obtained from the dead drop resolver (or the hardcoded C2 address) is combined with the path /base/api/statistics.php. PrivateLoader sends an HTTP GET request to this URL, which in turn fetches another URL that is XOR encrypted with a one-byte key (0x1d). Similar to the previous request, PrivateLoader expects the decrypted response from the C2 to be in the format URL:<PrivateLoader_Main_Component_URL>. An example of a decrypted response from the PrivateLoader C2 is shown below:",

The C2 address obtained from the dead drop resolver (or the hardcoded C2 address) is combined with the path /base/api/statistics.php. PrivateLoader sends an HTTP GET request to this URL, which in turn fetches another URL that is XOR encrypted with a one-byte key (0x1d). Similar to the previous request, PrivateLoader expects the decrypted response from the C2 to be in the format URL:<PrivateLoader_Main_Component_URL>. An example of a decrypted response from the PrivateLoader C2 is shown below:"
