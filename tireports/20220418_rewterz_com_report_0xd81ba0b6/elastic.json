            "text": "CaddyWiper is another destructive data wiper suspected to be targeting Ukraine. The wiper, which erases user data and information from associated drives, was discovered on several systems in a limited number of companies. By overwriting the data with a NULL value, CaddyWiper removes all files under C:\\Users as well as all files under accessible discs from D: to Z:.\nIf the size of the target file exceeds 0xA00000 bytes (10MB), it only wipes the first 0xA00000 bytes. CaddyWiper shares no code similarities with HermeticWiper or IsaacWiper, the other two new data wipes that have infected Ukrainian organizations. However, this wiper has a tactical overlap with HermeticWiper as it was deployed via the Windows domain controller, implying that the attackers had gained control of the Active Directory server."
