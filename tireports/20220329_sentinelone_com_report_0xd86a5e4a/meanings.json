                        "The TTPs uncovered during the incident align with previous reporting of the Hive Ransomware Affiliate Program, with the attackers having a preference for publicly available Penetration Testing frameworks and tooling (see TTPs table). Like many other ransomware groups, pre-deployment Powershell and BAT scripts are used to prepare the environment for distribution of the ransomware, while ADFind, SharpView, and BloodHound are used for Active Directory enumeration. Password spraying was performed with SharpHashSpray and SharpDomainSpray, while Rubeus was used to request TGTs. Cobalt Strike remains their implant of choice, and several different Cobalt Strike loaders were identified including: IPfuscated loader, Golang loader, and a vanilla Beacon DLL. Finally, GPOs and Scheduled Tasks are used to deploy digitally signed ransomware across the victims network."

                        "The TTPs uncovered during the incident align with previous reporting of the Hive Ransomware Affiliate Program, with the attackers having a preference for publicly available Penetration Testing frameworks and tooling (see TTPs table). Like many other ransomware groups, pre-deployment Powershell and BAT scripts are used to prepare the environment for distribution of the ransomware, while ADFind, SharpView, and BloodHound are used for Active Directory enumeration. Password spraying was performed with SharpHashSpray and SharpDomainSpray, while Rubeus was used to request TGTs. Cobalt Strike remains their implant of choice, and several different Cobalt Strike loaders were identified including: IPfuscated loader, Golang loader, and a vanilla Beacon DLL. Finally, GPOs and Scheduled Tasks are used to deploy digitally signed ransomware across the victims network.",
                        "Using byte sequences, sequences of WinAPI calls, and some hardcoded metadata affiliated with the malware author, we were able to identify a handful of other variants of this loader (hashes provided below with the IOCs), one of which we have dubbed UUIDfuscation and was also recently reported on by Jason Reaves. A Golang Cobalt Strike loader was also discovered during the investigation, which had a hardcoded source code path similar to what we have already seen with the IPfuscated samples, suggesting that the same author may be responsible for both.",
                        "Control flow is then passed to the shellcode, which is yet another Cobalt Strike stager attempting to download Beacon.",
                        "The shellcode is the common Cobalt Strike stager to download and execute Beacon. Here is a look at the PEB traversal to find one of the modules lists, followed by the ROT13 hash being calculated for target WinAPIs to execute.",
                        "In a recent IR engagement, our team happened upon a rather interesting packer (aka crypter or obfuscator) that was ultimately utilized to construct and execute shellcode responsible for downloading a Cobalt Strike Beacon. The sample at the end of this chain is not necessarily sophisticated or particularly novel, but it does leverage an interesting obfuscation technique that we have dubbed IPfuscation."

Like many other ransomware groups, pre-deployment Powershell and BAT scripts are used to prepare the environment for distribution of the ransomware, while ADFind, SharpView, and BloodHound are used for Active Directory enumeration. Password spraying was performed with SharpHashSpray and SharpDomainSpray, while Rubeus was used to request TGTs. Cobalt Strike remains their implant of choice, and several different Cobalt Strike loaders were identified including: IPfuscated loader, Golang loader, and a vanilla Beacon DLL. Finally, GPOs and Scheduled Tasks are used to deploy digitally signed ransomware across the victims network."

Like many other ransomware groups, pre-deployment Powershell and BAT scripts are used to prepare the environment for distribution of the ransomware, while ADFind, SharpView, and BloodHound are used for Active Directory enumeration. Password spraying was performed with SharpHashSpray and SharpDomainSpray, while Rubeus was used to request TGTs. Cobalt Strike remains their implant of choice, and several different Cobalt Strike loaders were identified including: IPfuscated loader, Golang loader, and a vanilla Beacon DLL. Finally, GPOs and Scheduled Tasks are used to deploy digitally signed ransomware across the victims network.",

A Golang Cobalt Strike loader was also discovered during the investigation, which had a hardcoded source code path similar to what we have already seen with the IPfuscated samples, suggesting that the same author may be responsible for both.",
