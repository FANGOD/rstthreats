As the findings of the <a href="https://info.zscaler.com/resources-industry-report-threatlabz-state-of-phishing-report" target="_blank">ThreatLabz 2022 Phishing Report </a>reveal, the challenge is getting harder: adversaries are getting craftier, and attackers are growing in numbers due to pre-built phishing kits available on the darknet. In this annual report, ThreatLabz offers deep insights on the current phishing threat landscape from a full year’s worth of phishing data from the world’s largest security cloud. Avoiding the latest breed of phishing attacks requires heightened awareness from users, additional context, and a zero trust approach. </p><p><a href="https://info.zscaler.com/resources-industry-report-threatlabz-state-of-phishing-report" target="_blank"><img class="lazyloaded" height="598" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/g0DQQD4hXaKgOPIZyFxjAaUuvygcwmDI214s7m7hs_xSVXqshWZcY1qT06qHchygUC4tyECyR7vFF3n3zNd2Ho4TNlF2MfSgE-hnWfkx7L7KRca3DDpeJ_lZDKSJT-3G_gzDOmpE" style="max-width:80%;height:auto;width:auto;"/></a></p><p>
</p><h1>Report Highlights</h1><p>From imitating popular brands like Microsoft to buying advertisements on Google and other search platforms, threat actors use a range of tactics and techniques to trick users into giving up sensitive information. Analyzing data from more than 200 billion daily transactions last year, the 2022 report found that:</p><p>Phishing attacks rose 29% in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by multiple trends:</p><ul><li>COVID-19 and work-from-home: Consumers engaged in more activities online, giving attackers new ways to take advantage.</li><li>Better threat protection: Organizations have been improving their threat prevention capabilities, leading attackers to use more sophisticated methods. Phishing provides adversaries with legitimate login credentials, allowing them to subvert security controls and compromise systems.</li><li>Phishing-as-a-service: Phishing kits package up pre-built tools to make phishing attacks easier to wage (even by adversaries who lack strong technical skills), and harder to spot for security teams. </li></ul><p><a href="https://info.zscaler.com/resources-industry-report-threatlabz-state-of-phishing-report" target="_blank"></a><a class="fancybox-media" href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dgC_ki4HrwsuFG3GtIZ6OvpfJY8ltK7zsFplnGpCTH0i0k-n9xGISVhNWd6pDIMKsmWfsAI1KpebjCWkpXj7yvORikpOn6DaGRrvgTFLUe9ge-2tK2B08YE_xYQQefk-ZftYsvnQ"><img class="lazyloaded" height="332" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dgC_ki4HrwsuFG3GtIZ6OvpfJY8ltK7zsFplnGpCTH0i0k-n9xGISVhNWd6pDIMKsmWfsAI1KpebjCWkpXj7yvORikpOn6DaGRrvgTFLUe9ge-2tK2B08YE_xYQQefk-ZftYsvnQ" style="max-width:80%;height:auto;width:auto;"/></a></p><p>More than 96% of attacks in our study lacked a referring domain, indicating that the victim clicked a direct link to the phishing site through their email, SMS, or another client. Email continues to be the top phishing vector, but other vectors such as SMS are growing: consumers trust text messages more than emails, and a successful SMS phishing (“SMiShing”) attack can give attackers the smartphone access that they need to bypass two-factor authentication. The top 20 referring domains included search platforms, corporate forums and marketplaces, sharing sites, e-commerce tools, and others.</p><p> Retail and wholesale saw a massive 436% leap in phishing attacks in 2021 as attackers took advantage of COVID-boosted online shopping trends. Retail and wholesale moved from the fifth-most phished industry category all the way to first, ahead of last year’s most phished industry, manufacturing. </p><p>The United States is (once again) the most targeted country in our study with more than 60% of phishing attempts. However, phishing only rose 7% in the United States in 2021, whereas the increase was much higher elsewhere. ThreatLabz breaks down the full list of the 10 most targeted countries with details on which countries saw the sharpest increases in phishing attacks during 2021.</p><p><a href="https://info.zscaler.com/resources-industry-report-threatlabz-state-of-phishing-report" target="_blank"></a><a class="fancybox-media" href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/sT6eqvKXEEceVswwLju5oFcJ2lh5Nqv7GUsjwlxv7YRqUdPTYJo_PX9ibypdhz6z18dbii8O7TzC3MxLsufzPEKwCWclv6TmK3NYMH_8XEN5m2Bnm5Hzef_mm9w9EqD99-u70wq2"><img class="lazyloaded" height="331" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/sT6eqvKXEEceVswwLju5oFcJ2lh5Nqv7GUsjwlxv7YRqUdPTYJo_PX9ibypdhz6z18dbii8O7TzC3MxLsufzPEKwCWclv6TmK3NYMH_8XEN5m2Bnm5Hzef_mm9w9EqD99-u70wq2" style="max-width:80%;height:auto;width:auto;"/></a></p><p>Additionally, in this year’s report, ThreatLabz analyzes popular techniques used by phishing threat actors and explores some of the key drivers intensifying enterprise risk, including:</p><ul><li>Top targeted geographies and industry verticals </li><li>Personalization and highly targeted attacks</li><li>Zero-day vulnerabilities and rapid exploits</li><li>Phishing-as-a-service and phishing kits</li><li>Safe domains and trusted platforms</li></ul><p><a href="https://info.zscaler.com/resources-industry-report-threatlabz-state-of-phishing-report" target="_blank"><img class="lazyload" height="525" style="max-width:80%;height:auto;width:auto;"/></a></p><p> </p><h1>Improve Your Phishing Defenses</h1><p>Industry statistics reveal that the average organization receives dozens of phishing emails daily, with financial losses snowballing as losses incurred from malware and ransomware attacks drive up the average costs of landed phishing attacks year over year.

Your organization must implement phishing prevention controls as part of a broader zero trust strategy that enables you to detect active breaches and minimize damages caused by successful breaches. The Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange is built on a holistic zero trust architecture to minimize the attack surface, prevent compromise, eliminate lateral movement, and stop data loss. Zscaler helps stop phishing in the following ways:</p><ul><li>Prevents compromise: Full SSL inspection at scale, browser isolation, and policy-driven access control to prevent access to suspicious websites.</li><li>Eliminates lateral movement: Connect users directly to apps, not the network, to limit the blast radius of a potential incident.</li><li>Shuts down compromised users and insider threats: If an attacker gains access to your identity system, we can prevent private app exploit attempts with in-line inspection and detect the most sophisticated attackers with integrated deception.</li><li>Stops data loss: Inspect data-in-motion and data-at-rest to prevent potential data theft from an active attacker.</li></ul><p> </p><h2>Related Zscaler products:</h2><p> </p><p><a href="https://www.zscaler.com/products/zscaler-internet-access">Zscaler Internet Access</a> helps identify and stop malicious activity by routing and inspecting all internet traffic through the Zero Trust Exchange.
