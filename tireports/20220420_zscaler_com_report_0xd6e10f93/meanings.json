Email continues to be the top phishing vector, but other vectors such as SMS are growing: consumers trust text messages more than emails, and a successful SMS phishing (SMiShing) attack can give attackers the smartphone access that they need to bypass two-factor authentication. The top 20 referring domains included search platforms, corporate forums and marketplaces, sharing sites, e-commerce tools, and others.",

                        "For decades, phishing has been a complex and time-consuming challenge for every security team. As the findings of the ThreatLabz 2022 Phishing Report reveal, the challenge is getting harder: adversaries are getting craftier, and attackers are growing in numbers due to pre-built phishing kits available on the darknet. In this annual report, ThreatLabz offers deep insights on the current phishing threat landscape from a full years worth of phishing data from the worlds largest security cloud. Avoiding the latest breed of phishing attacks requires heightened awareness from users, additional context, and a zero trust approach."
