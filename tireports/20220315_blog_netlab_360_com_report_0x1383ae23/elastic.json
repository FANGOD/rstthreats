What stands out is that the network traffic generated by this sample triggered a DNS Tunnel alert in our system, We decided to take a close look, and indeed, it is a new botnet family, which we named B1txor20 based on its propagation using the file name \"b1t\", the XOR encryption algorithm, and the RC4 algorithm key length of 20 bytes.\nIn short, B1txor20 is a Backdoor for the Linux platform, which uses DNS Tunnel technology to build C2 communication channels. In addition to the traditional backdoor functions, B1txor20 also has functions such as opening Socket5 proxy and remotely downloading and installing Rootkit.\nAnother interesting point is that we found that many developed features are not put into use (in IDA, there is no cross-reference); some features have bugs. we presume that the author of B1txor20 will continue to improve and open different features according to different scenarios, so maybe we will meet B1txor20's siblings in the future."

Simply put, when B1txor20 executes, it will first disguise itself as a [netns] process, run a single instance through the PID file/var/run/.netns.pid, and then use /etc/machine-id, /tmp/.138171241 or /dev/urandom to generate the BotID, then decrypt the domain name used for DNS Tunnel and the RC4 secret key used to encrypt the traffic and test the connectivity of the DNS server, and finally use DNS Tunnel to send registration information to C2 and wait for the execution of the commands issued by C2. Here we will not go into details about the regular functions, we will take a look at the DNS Tunnel implementation of the B1txor20."

In this way, Bot and C2 achieve communication with the help of DNS protocol.\nIn such a network structure, there are 3 key points:\n1:C2 must support the DNS protocol\n2: Specific encoding techniques\n3: The way DNS requests are sent\nThe following section will analyze the technical details of B1txor20's communication around these points, in conjunction with the traffic generated by B1txor20 in practice."

It is obvious that the front Base64 string is the information sent by Bot to C2, how is it generated?\nFirst, the B1txor20 packet has a pre-construction process, which can be seen in the format of0xFF + BotId + 0xFF + Stage + 0xFF + TaskInfo, 0xFF is used to separate different items, and when the construction is finished, according to different Stage values, different tasks will fill theTaskInfosection accordingly.\nTake the above task as an example, the Stage value is 1. Through the gather_info function, the information of \"sysinfo_uptime,uid,hostname\" is filled into TaskInfo, and they are separated by0x0a.\nWhen the required information is ready, B1txor20 uses theprocess_queryfunction to further process the above information, which includes three processes: ZLIB compression, RC4 encryption, and Base64 encoding.\nThe secret key used in RC4 encryption is the string \"EnLgLKHhy20f8A1dX85l\" mentioned in the previous decryption section, and the Alphabet String used in Base64 is ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789^_.\nFinally, B1txor20 adds 1 byte of status and 4 bytes of random string before the Base64 string generated above, and then splices it with domain, which is the final domain name to be queried. The value of status is ['0', '1', '2'], 0 means that the current query is truncated, the subsequent query and the current should be spelled into the same; 1 means that when the query is complete.\nLet's take a look at the actual generated query 1HQoOKPvBKs8yqO1tTUQkCqGWN9anB4RAGWhnJy8A.dns.webserv.systems, removing the first 5 bytes, and the .dns.webserv.systems part to get KPvBKs8yqO1tTUQkCqGWN9anB4RAGWhnJy8A, then use Base64 decoding, RC4 decryption, ZLIB decompression, you can get the following raw data.\nFrom the data content and format, it can correspond with our previous description one by one, indicating that our previous analysis is correct."
