                        "B1txor20 tests the connectivity of 3 DNS (8.8.8.8:53, 8.8.8.4:53, 194.165.16.24:443) servers with the following code snippet.",
                        "B1txor20 decrypts the domain name and RC4 secret key stored in the sample with the following code snippet.",
                        "In short, B1txor20 is a Backdoor for the Linux platform, which uses DNS Tunnel technology to build C2 communication channels. In addition to the traditional backdoor functions, B1txor20 also has functions such as opening Socket5 proxy and remotely downloading and installing Rootkit.",
                        "B1txor20 supports a total of 14 instructions, and the correspondence between instruction number and function is shown in the following table.",
                        "When the above preparations are completed, B1txor20 enters the final stage, using DNS Tunnel to establish communication with C2 and wait for the execution of the commands sent by C2.",
                        "The format of B1txor20's Tunnel domain name isBase64-Like String+.dns.websrv.systems. It is obvious that the front Base64 string is the information sent by Bot to C2, how is it generated?",
                        "We have captured a total of four different B1txor20 samples, their functions are almost the same, a total of 15 function numbers are supported, according to these functions, B1txor20 can be characterized as: using DNS Tunnel to establish C2 channel, support direct connection and relay, while using ZLIB compression, RC4 encryption, BASE64 encodingto protect the traffic of the backdoor Trojan, mainly targets ARM, X64 CPU architecture of the Linux platform.",
                        "When the above domain name construction is complete, B1txor20 generates and sends DNS requests using the RES series API.",
                        "First, the B1txor20 packet has a pre-construction process, which can be seen in the format of0xFF + BotId + 0xFF + Stage + 0xFF + TaskInfo, 0xFF is used to separate different items, and when the construction is finished, according to different Stage values, different tasks will fill theTaskInfosection accordingly.",
                        "B1txor20 uses the following code snippet to read 32 bytes from /etc/machine-id, or /tmp/.138171241, for generating BotId, and if it fails, a 16 bytes of data will be generated via /dev/urandom and will be written to the previous 2 files.",
                        "The following section will analyze the technical details of B1txor20's communication around these points, in conjunction with the traffic generated by B1txor20 in practice.",
                        "When the required information is ready, B1txor20 uses theprocess_queryfunction to further process the above information, which includes three processes: ZLIB compression, RC4 encryption, and Base64 encoding.",
                        "Through the traffic in the above figure, we can see that the SLD used by B1txor20 is webserv.systems, and using the DIG command, we can see that this SLD is point to IP 194.165.16.24; and the DNS resolution service is turned on at this IP 194, so we can determine that the C2 of B1txor20 is exactly 194.165.16.24.",
                        "The sample of B1txor20 is dynamically linked, so it is relatively easy to reverse. Simply put, when B1txor20 executes, it will first disguise itself as a [netns] process, run a single instance through the PID file/var/run/.netns.pid, and then use /etc/machine-id, /tmp/.138171241 or /dev/urandom to generate the BotID, then decrypt the domain name used for DNS Tunnel and the RC4 secret key used to encrypt the traffic and test the connectivity of the DNS server, and finally use DNS Tunnel to send registration information to C2 and wait for the execution of the commands issued by C2. Here we will not go into details about the regular functions, we will take a look at the DNS Tunnel implementation of the B1txor20.",
                        "Finally, B1txor20 adds 1 byte of status and 4 bytes of random string before the Base64 string generated above, and then splices it with domain, which is the final domain name to be queried. The value of status is ['0', '1', '2'], 0 means that the current query is truncated, the subsequent query and the current should be spelled into the same; 1 means that when the query is complete."
