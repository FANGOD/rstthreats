                        "A Vietnam-based threat group, APT32 (OceanLotus Group) is active since 2014. It is known for carrying out sophisticated attacks on several private companies, journalists, foreign governments, and activists with a primary concentration on Southeast Asian countries including Vietnam, Philippines, Laos, and Cambodia. This threat group has utilized smart web breaches to compromise victims. APT32 conducts targeted operations that are consistent with Vietnamese state goals using a unique suite of fully-featured malware in combination with commercially accessible tools. The APT32 attack includes meaningless code to deceive security tools, allowing it to go undetected."
