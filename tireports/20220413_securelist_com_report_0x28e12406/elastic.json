            "text": "Emotet was first found in the wild in 2014. Back then its main functionality was stealing user banking credentials. Since then it has survived numerous transformations, started delivering other malware and finally became a powerful botnet. In January 2021 Emotet was disrupted by a joint effort of different countries authorities. It took the threat actors almost 10 months to rebuild the infrastructure, whereupon Emotet returned in November. At that time, Trickbot malware was used to deliver Emotet. Now, Emotet is spreading by itself in malicious spam campaigns.\nBased on recent Emotet protocol analysis and C2 responses, we can say that now Emotet can download 16 additional modules. We were able to retrieve 10 of them (including two different copies of the Spam module), used by Emotet for Credential/Password/Account/E-mail stealing and spamming. In this post, we provide a brief analysis of these modules, as well as statistics on recent Emotet attacks."

            "text": "A typical Emotet infection begins with spam e-mails delivered with Microsoft Office (Word, Excel) attachments. Malicious macros are used to start PowerShell, and download and execute an Emotet DLL. Depending on the available access, Emotet creates a subdirectory with a random name in the %Windows%\\SysWOW64\\ or %User%\\AppData\\Local\\ directory, and copies itself there under a randomly generated name and extension. The exported Control_RunDLL function is used to run the main activity of the Emotet DLL.\nEmotet infection execution chain\nAfter being run, the Emotet malware creates a service by calling the CreateServiceW() function. A randomly generated name and extension, which were used to create a copy, act as service names.\nCreateServiceW() function with arguments\nIf the attempt to create a new service fails, Emotet creates a new registry key in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run with the same names that were used when creating the service.\nAutostart key in registry\nAs soon as the Emotet DLL is launched, it registers with one of the 20 C2 IPs that are hardcoded in encrypted form into the malware body. Downloaded modules can also include additional C2 IPs. The following data is used for bot registration:\nRegistration data\nTogether with the registration data, the victims public key that is generated in every run is also sent to the C2. Unlike previous versions that used RSA to encrypt the generated AES key, this newest Emotet sample uses the ECDH (Elliptic curve DiffieHellman) algorithm, using the victims generated key pair together with Emotets public key hardcoded into the code to derive the AES key for encrypting the communication. This is done with use of the Windows API BCryptSecretAgreement.\nDuring our monitoring we have observed that after registration the C2 replies with the Process List module payload. The module comes in the form of a DLL that is parsed and loaded directly into the Rundll32 process. Its entry point is called by passing a specific structure to its DllMain function. It is also worth noting that Emotet uses the ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) to verify the payload integrity before loading it.\nPseudo code to load Emotets second-stage DLL directly into memory\nAside from loading the DLL into memory, there are other ways to run the payload. For example:\nwrite the DLL payload to disk and run it through regsvr32.exe -s %s or rundll32.exe %s,Control_RunDLL\nwrite the payload to disk and attempt to call CreateProcess or duplicate the user token to call CreateProcessAsUser\nDuring communication, C2 returns the module bodies and configuration. Based on the configuration, the malware selects the way to run the payload module. During our research, all the modules we retrieved were launched in the parent process, but a separate thread is started for each new module. Each module has its own numeric ID, and contains its own C2 list. However, all the modules we retrieved contained the same list of C2, except the Spam module. Emotet modules are delivered on demand, and there are always a few junk bytes that vary in different samples of the same module. This is likely to avoid cloud scanning or file hash detection.\nRandom bytes changed between Process List module binaries"

In the figure above, we can see that the control flow obfuscation technique is used with the variable state (yellow-colored). Also, all API calls are resolved during runtime. This is why this API resolution layer can use junk arguments (red-framed). Code listings can be larger and more obfuscated, which is why it makes no sense to show them for all modules."
