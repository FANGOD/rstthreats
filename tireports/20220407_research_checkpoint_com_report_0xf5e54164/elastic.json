            "text": "When you search for Anti-Virus (AV) solutions to protect your mobile devices, you dont expect these solutions to do the opposite i.e. make devices vulnerable to malware.\nThis what the Check Point Research (CPR) team encountered while analyzing suspicious applications found in Google Play. These applications pretended to be genuine AV solutions while in reality they downloaded and installed an Android Stealer called Sharkbot.\nSharkbot steals credentials and banking information. The malware implements a geofencing feature and evasion techniques that makes it stand out in the field. It also makes use of Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA), an aspect rarely used in the world of Android malware. Sharkbot lures victims to enter their credentials in windows that mimic benign credential input forms. When the user enters credentials in these windows, the compromised data is sent to a malicious server.\nSharkbot has a handful of tricks up its sleeve. It doesnt target every potential victim it encounters, but only select ones, using the geofencing feature to identify and ignore users from China, India, Romania, Russia, Ukraine or Belarus.\nFigure 1 -Geofencing feature as implemented in Sharkbot.\nEvasion techniques are also a part of Sharkbots arsenal. If the malware detects it is running in a sandbox, it stops the execution and quits.\nFigure 2 Evasion technique encountered in Sharkbot.\nIn the Google Play store, we spotted a total of six different applications that were spreading Sharkbot.\nFigure 3 Icons and names of the applications we found.\nThese six applications came from three developer accounts, Zbynek Adamcik, Adelmio Pagnotto and Bingo Like Inc. When we checked the history of these accounts, we saw that two of them were active in the fall of 2021. Some of the applications linked to these accounts were removed from Google Play, but still exist in unofficial markets. This could mean that the actor behind the applications is trying to stay under the radar while still involved in malicious activity.\nThe applications removed from Google Play were downloaded and installed approximately 15 thousand times. Following information we got from www.appbrain.com.\nFigure 4 Statistics of the developers accounts. Unpublished applications are outlined.\nAfter spotting the applications that spread Sharkbot, we immediately contacted Google and reported our findings. After a fast yet thorough examination, all the applications that were found spreading Sharkbot were permanently removed from the Google Play store.\nHowever, the Sharkbot malware is still active. In this article, we provide a deep technical analysis of Sharkbot and reveal the steps that helped us to spot the malware-spreading applications on Google Play."

            "text": "We already mentioned that Sharkbot implements evasion techniques and a geofencing feature, but these are not its only noteworthy tricks. Another distinctive aspect present in Sharkbot is the use of DGA, which is rarely seen in Android malware. With DGA, one sample with a hardcoded seed generates 7 domains per week. Including all the seeds and algorithms we have observed, there is a total of 56 domains per week, i.e., 8 different combinations of seed/algorithm.\nSpeaking of its main functionality, Sharkbot implements the traditional toolkit for Android bankers and stealers. As a vivid example, we saw the abuse of the Accessibility Service which provides the application with access to all the data which is seen by the user and also allows the application to interact with an interface as though as it were a person.\nDuring our observations, 27 versions of the bot were discovered. The main differences between the versions are different DGA seeds as well as different botnetID and ownerID fields. For more information on the different versions and a change log, see the Appendix."

            "text": "At the time of publication, we counted 8 IP addresses which were Sharkbots CnC servers at different times. During our research of the infrastructure, we spotted a field commandID in some answers from the server. This field is used to identify each command sent from the server to the client.\nAfter more detailed analysis, we can assume that this field is increased by one for each command sent from the server. During our experiments, we noticed that this value does not depend on the particular CnC server but instead is a common value for all of them.\nHere are the logs of the requests and response exchange with different servers on January 25, 2022, one after the other:\nServer mnbvakjjouxir0zkzmd[.]xyz with IP 31[.]214.157.112 :\nFigure 31 Request to the server, at 15:45:12.487.\nFigure 32 Answer from the server, at 15:45:13.80.\nServer mjaynxbvakjjouxir0z[.]xyz with IP 109[.]230.199.99:\nFigure 33 Request to the server, at 15:48:06.448.\nFigure 34 Answer from the server, at 15:48:07.45.\nAs you can see, the value of commandID changed by exactly one. From this we can assume even more:\nThere is one real server, and the others work as relays.\nWe can use the values of the field commandID to evaluate the activity of the server sending commands to clients.\nUsing the value of the commandID field, we can estimate the activity of Sharkbots servers. We calculated an average increase of the commandID value per hour for the period from January 26 to March 23 and got the following result:\nFigure 35 Sharkbot server activity.\nWe can see that activity increased, with the peak at the beginning of March. This correlates with the active use of Sharkbots dropper on Google Play.\nThe following chart shows the number of unique IP addresses encountered in the period from February 14 to February 20:\nBlue bars denote the count of unique IP addresses per day.\nRed bars denote the count of unique IP addresses, excluding the ones already seen in the previous days.\nFigure 36 Unique IP addressed statistics observed in the middle of February.\nDuring our observation for this particular week in February, we saw approximately one thousand unique IP addresses in total.\nThe following chart shows the location-based statistics. The main targets are Italy and the United Kingdom.\nFigure 37 Regional statistics."

            "text": "In the ever-changing contemporary (cyber-)world, nothing should be taken for granted. If a new AV solution appears in Google Play today, theres no way to guarantee it wont turn out to be a malware spreading threat tomorrow. This is the exact case we observed with the Sharkbot malware.\nIn this spreading scheme, the malware itself is not uploaded to Google Play but rather the intermediate link is, which masquerades as a legitimate software. As we can see by more than 15,000 installations for all the applications in total, people can be lured by a beautiful icon and a promise to protect their devices.\nThe Check Point Research Team is constantly monitoring this and other threats in the mobile landscape, and we immediately notified Google of the malicious behavior we encountered. Despite a fast response from Google, which removed applications linked to threat actor accounts, more attempts were made in Google Play with more droppers from different accounts. They were all subsequently removed as well, but the damage from 15,000 thousand installations was already done.\nGoogle Play Protects solid reputation should not decrease user awareness that threat actors are constantly evolving their malware and looking for new schemes to execute this malware on victims devices. Our advice to Android users:\nInstall applications only from trusted and verified publishers.\nIf you see an application from a new publisher, search for analogs from a trusted one.\nReport to Google any seemingly suspicious applications you encounter."

If a malware operator has several servers, then its easy to block access to them either by a corporate firewall, or with the AV software installed on the device. After the CnCs are blocked, an operator can change the domain name of the CnC server but how are already installed clients supposed to learn about the server change? This is where Domain Generation Algorithm enters the scene.\nDGA is an algorithm by which a malicious client and malicious actor can change the CnC server in concert, without any communication. DGA is a piece of code which runs on a client and generates dynamic names for the CnC server, so if today one CnC server is blocked then within a day, a week or a month, a new name for the CnC will be generated and used. This algorithm complicates the process of blocking malware operators servers.\nUsually DGA consists of two parts: the actual algorithm, and the constants used by the algorithm. These constants are called DGA seeds.\nAs we mentioned earlier, implementing DGA is rarely observed in Android malware, but Sharkbot is an exception.\nBefore the connection to the DGA domains is made, Sharkbot attempts to connect to the static URL hardcoded inside:\nFigure 21 Static CnC URL.\nOnly if the static server does not respond, Sharkbot uses an embedded DGA procedure to get relevant domains for the current date and then attempts to connect to them one by one:\nFigure 22 DGA code.\nThe final string for DGA consists of several fields:\nCurrent year (using since 02.09.2022)\nCurrent week number\nseed-word\nKey pojBI9LHGFdfgegjjsJ99hvVGHVOjhksdf\nWe noticed that the seed-word is changed across samples.
