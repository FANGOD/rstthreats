This stealer is freely available and can be used by multiple threat actors, and since our initial research push, weve already seen it change hands, so its impossible to tell where this could head next. We have observed a focus on infecting Russian speaking victims under the guise of game cheats, key generators and pirated software, which likely indicates a current focus on home users.",
                        "U.S. security officials continue to sound alarms over potential cyber attacks from Russian state-sponsored actors. Jen Easterly, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, appeared on 60 Minutes over the weekend to echo the Biden administrations message that federal agencies, companies and private individuals need to be ready for when, not if, a large-scale attack happens. We are seeing evolving intelligence about Russian planning for potential attacks. And we have to assume that there's going to be a breach. There's going to be an incident. There's going to be an attack, she said in the interview. (CBS News, Politico)"

                        "Computer manufacturer Lenovo warned that dozens of their laptops are vulnerable to an attack that could persist even after a hard-drive replacement or operating system re-install. Two of the three vulnerabilities the company disclosed this week deal with the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) drivers. These were meant to only be used during the manufacturing process, but accidentally ended up part of the BIOS image that shipped with the computers. Several models of Lenovo laptops will not receive appropriate patches to fix these issues, as they are already past the End of Development Support cycle. (Dark Reading, PC World)"
