By the time we had gotten a good handle on the Haskers Gang newest malware, the threat actor had already put it up for sale and announced they were transitioning ownership to another group. ZingoStealer leverages Telegram chat features to facilitate malware executable build delivery and data exfiltration. It can exfiltrate sensitive information such as credentials, steal cryptocurrency wallet information and mine cryptocurrency on victims' systems. Regardless of who owns it, this is still worth watching out for."

This stealer is freely available and can be used by multiple threat actors, and since our initial research push, weve already seen it change hands, so its impossible to tell where this could head next. We have observed a focus on infecting Russian speaking victims under the guise of game cheats, key generators and pirated software, which likely indicates a current focus on home users."

Outside of that, as I was writing above, its always important to double check where youre about to download something from. The attackers in this case are infiltrating Telegram chats and Discord servers to spread fake video game cheats. If you do want to download a mod for a game, make sure its coming from a legitimate, trusted store."

Jen Easterly, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, appeared on 60 Minutes over the weekend to echo the Biden administrations message that federal agencies, companies and private individuals need to be ready for when, not if, a large-scale attack happens. We are seeing evolving intelligence about Russian planning for potential attacks. And we have to assume that there's going to be a breach. There's going to be an incident. There's going to be an attack, she said in the interview. (CBS News, Politico)\nOracle released its quarterly security update this week, bringing fixes for a whopping 520 vulnerabilities across its massive suite of products. More than 70 of the patches are for vulnerabilities rated critical, including three that have a severity score of a maximum 10. The company doubled down on its patching message this quarter, too, warning users that its seen attackers actively exploiting previously disclosed, but unpatched, Oracle vulnerabilities. Oracle Fusion Middleware received the most patches, including fixes for 54 vulnerabilities, 41 of which could be remotely exploitable without authentication. (ZDNet, Oracle)\nComputer manufacturer Lenovo warned that dozens of their laptops are vulnerable to an attack that could persist even after a hard-drive replacement or operating system re-install. Two of the three vulnerabilities the company disclosed this week deal with the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) drivers. These were meant to only be used during the manufacturing process, but accidentally ended up part of the BIOS image that shipped with the computers. Several models of Lenovo laptops will not receive appropriate patches to fix these issues, as they are already past the End of Development Support cycle. (Dark Reading, PC World)"
