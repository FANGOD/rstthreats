The exploit targets a vulnerability in Microsofts Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) that occurs due to the ms-msdt MSProtocol URI scheme which could load code and execute via PowerShell despite macros being disabled.<crlf>Successful exploitation of the CVE enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted host. However, the attacker must socially engineer the victim into opening a specially crafted file to exploit this issue which requires a targeted effort to succeed making the vulnerability less prominent to unskilled actors but highly relevant to ransomware gangs such as CONTI, CL0P and ALPHV. To combat this new threat businesses must focus on threat preventionan approach in which Minerva excels.",

As the exploit targets MS Office and relies on social engineering and has already been exploited in the wild it is highly likely that ransomware operators are racing to use the CVE as part of their toolkit, and some are likely to already operate a working exploit."

The exploit targets a vulnerability in Microsofts Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) that occurs due to the ms-msdt MSProtocol URI scheme which could load code and execute via PowerShell despite macros being disabled.<crlf>Successful exploitation of the CVE enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted host. However, the attacker must socially engineer the victim into opening a specially crafted file to exploit this issue which requires a targeted effort to succeed making the vulnerability less prominent to unskilled actors but highly relevant to ransomware gangs such as CONTI, CL0P and ALPHV. To combat this new threat businesses must focus on threat preventionan approach in which Minerva excels."

The exploit targets a vulnerability in Microsofts Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) that occurs due to the ms-msdt MSProtocol URI scheme which could load code and execute via PowerShell despite macros being disabled.<crlf>Successful exploitation of the CVE enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted host. However, the attacker must socially engineer the victim into opening a specially crafted file to exploit this issue which requires a targeted effort to succeed making the vulnerability less prominent to unskilled actors but highly relevant to ransomware gangs such as CONTI, CL0P and ALPHV. To combat this new threat businesses must focus on threat preventionan approach in which Minerva excels."

                        "The new zero-day MS Word vulnerability recently discovered by Nao_Sec on May 27, 2022, titled 'Follina' (CVE-2022-30190) targeting Microsoft Office is being actively utilised, Minerva researchers found. The exploit targets a vulnerability in Microsofts Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) that occurs due to the ms-msdt MSProtocol URI scheme which could load code and execute via PowerShell despite macros being disabled.<crlf>Successful exploitation of the CVE enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted host. However, the attacker must socially engineer the victim into opening a specially crafted file to exploit this issue which requires a targeted effort to succeed making the vulnerability less prominent to unskilled actors but highly relevant to ransomware gangs such as CONTI, CL0P and ALPHV. To combat this new threat businesses must focus on threat preventionan approach in which Minerva excels."
