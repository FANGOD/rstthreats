In the latest campaign conducted by the threat actor, Cisco Talos observed multiple delivery methods, such as executables masquerading as installers of legitimate applications, archive files and maldocs to target Indian entities and individuals. These infection chains led to the deployment of three different types of implants, two of which we had not previously observed:\nCrimsonRAT: A remote access trojan (RAT) family that Transparent Tribe frequently uses to conduct espionage operations against their targets.\nA previously unknown Python-based stager that leads to the deployment of .NET-based reconnaissance tools and RATs.\nA lightweight .NET-based implant to run arbitrary code on the infected system.\nThis campaign also uses fake domains mimicking legitimate government and pseudo-government organizations to deliver malicious payloads, a typical Transparent Tribe tactic."

            "text": "As early as June 2021, the attackers primarily used malicious documents (maldocs) as an initial infection vector to deliver the malicious downloaders. This vector consisted of a malicious macro that would download and activate the downloader on the infected endpoint. This practice continued into July 2021.\nHowever, beginning with June 2021, there was also a steady evolution in the distribution tactics used in this campaign. Around this time, we began observing the use of non-traditional initial entry mechanisms throughout the course of this campaign, suggesting a clear intention of aggressively infecting targets for espionage.\nFor instance, in June 2021, the attackers used IMG files for distribution, containing multiple infection artifacts all COVID-19 themed to trick targets into getting infected. Wrapping malware in IMG files is a tactic gaining traction with crimeware operators and APTs as a way to deliver malware to victims since newer versions of the Windows OS natively support IMG files.\nMalicious IMG distributed by Transparent Tribe.\nThe malicious image consists of four files:\nMalicious Python-based stager.\nDecoy PDF document containing a COVID-19-themed lure.\nVBS file for executing the stager and displaying the decoy.\nMalicious LNK file for activating the VBS on the endpoint.\nIn September 2021, the actors switched up their initial infection artifact and used VHDX files delivering the malicious droppers. VHDX files\ndo not retain\nMark Of the Web (MOTW)\nstamps and thus artifacts such as maldocs, delivered through these wrappers aren't identified as originating from the internet by Microsoft utilities such as Word, Excel etc. - allowing the attackers to run malicious code on the endpoint without any Microsoft warnings.\nThe variant of the downloaders used here, previously disclosed by\nCyble\n, masqueraded as an app from the\nCanteen Stores Department\n(CSD) of the Government of India. On execution, this variant would open the legitimate website for CSD on the target's system. However, as seen previously with Transparent Tribe, the threat actors continued the development of similar infection chains consisting of various themes to distribute their malware without regard for any previous public disclosures.\nThe threat actor then introduced the use of RAR archives to distribute malicious malware in November 2021. The RAR archive consisted of the downloader, this time downloading a highly specific decoy PDF containing the work history of an Indian government official. The RAR archives are typically password-protected and hosted on public media sharing websites. Therefore, it is highly likely that Transparent Tribe used spearphishing emails to deliver download URLs for the archives to their targets via emails containing the passwords for the archives.\nTimeline of evolution of entry vectors:"

            "text": "This campaign saw the use of multiple types of lures and decoys to target Indian government personnel. This is a targeting tactic typical of groups operating under the Pakistani nexus of APT groups, such as Transparent Tribe and\nSideCopy\n.\nFor example, in July 2021, we saw the attackers use themes related to the 7th Indian Central Pay Commission (7th CPC) for government employees in maldocs to deliver the Python-based stager that deployed malware on the infected endpoints. Transparent Tribe will frequently use the 7th CPC as a topic of interest to trick victims into opening maldocs and infecting themselves.\nMaldoc with 7th CPC themes.\nWe also saw the use of COVID-themed lures and decoys containing advisories primarily targeting employees of the government of India. This is another tactic that the Transparent Tribe has utilized in\npast operations\n.\nCOVID-19-themed decoy used against government employees.\nOver the past year, we have observed this threat actor heavily utilize women's resumes to target individuals of interest. This is inline with their tactic of honey trapping targets by using such malicious resumes and executables that display alluring pictures. This campaign, however, used a similar yet distinct theme. Instead of resumes, we observed the use of a decoy document in November 2021 that detailed a male Indian\nMinistry of\nDefence\n(MoD)\nemployee's work experience.\nService history of an MoD official used as a lure/decoy.\nAnother TTP used by Transparent Tribe in their operations is the cloning of legitimate websites into fake ones owned and operated by the attackers. These fake websites are used along with typo-squatted or similarly spelled domains to appear legitimate but serve malicious artifacts as part of the attackers' infection chains. One such example in this campaign is the malicious domain dsoi[.]info. This domain is a direct copy of the legitimate website of the\nDefence\nService Officers' Institute (DSOI)\nof India, created by cloning content using HTTrack, a free website copier program.\nWe've seen this tactic (cloning legitimate websites using HTTrack) used by Transparent Tribe in the past to deliver\nObliqueRAT\nmalware payloads around mid-2021.\nTransparent Tribe commonly uses malicious artifacts against Indian targets, masquerading as legitimate applications maintained by the government of India. In September 2021, Talos disclosed\nOperation Armor Piercer\n, which consisted of the use of themes pertaining to the Kavach MFA application to spread commodity RATs. The SideCopy APT group also uses trojans such as\nMargulasRAT\npretending to be a VPN application for India's\nNational Informatics Centre (NIC)\n. This new campaign from Transparent Tribe also saw fake installers for the Kavach application being used to deploy CrimsonRAT and other malware.\nThe use of CrimsonRAT in operations such as these is expected of Transparent Tribe. It has been seen in the wild for years and is the tool of choice for the threat actors in campaigns that cast a relatively wide net for targeting their victims. This is unlike ObliqueRAT, which is used in highly targeted operations by Transparent Tribe.\nThe use of new bespoke malware in addition to the RATs indicates the group is diversifying their malware portfolio to achieve an even greater degree of success. In another common trend, we have also observed Transparent Tribe quickly develop and deploy bespoke, small and lightweight stagers and downloaders that can be modified with relative ease (and discarded if needed), leading to the deployment of their actual implants meant to provide long term access into their targets' networks and systems."

This campaign furthers this targeting and their central goal of establishing long term access for espionage. The use of multiple types of delivery vehicles and file formats indicates that the group is aggressively trying to infect their targets with their implants such as CrimsonRAT. They have continued the use of fake domains masquerading as government and quasi-government entities, as well as the use of generically themed content-hosting domains to host malware. Although not very sophisticated, this is an extremely motivated and persistent adversary that constantly evolves tactics to infect their targets.\nOrganizations should remain vigilant against such threats, as they are likely to proliferate in the future. In-depth defense strategies based on a risk analysis approach can deliver the best results in the prevention. However, this should always be complemented by a good incident response plan which has been not only tested with tabletop exercises and reviewed and improved every time it's put to the test on real engagements."
