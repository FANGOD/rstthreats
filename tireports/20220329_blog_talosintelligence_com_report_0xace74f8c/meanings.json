In the latest campaign conducted by the threat actor, Cisco Talos observed multiple delivery methods, such as executables masquerading as installers of legitimate applications, archive files and maldocs to target Indian entities and individuals.

ObliqueRAT is primarily reserved for highly targeted attacks on government personnel and in operations where stealth is a prime focus of the attackers' infection chain. This implant has also seen a constant evolution in deployment tactics and malicious functionalities over time.<crlf>Custom malware used by Transparent Tribe consists of easily and quickly deployable downloaders, droppers and lightweight RATs containing limited capabilities as opposed to CrimsonRAT and ObliqueRAT.",

This campaign furthers this targeting and their central goal of establishing long term access for espionage. The use of multiple types of delivery vehicles and file formats indicates that the group is aggressively trying to infect their targets with their implants such as CrimsonRAT. They have continued the use of fake domains masquerading as government and quasi-government entities, as well as the use of generically themed content-hosting domains to host malware. Although not very sophisticated, this is an extremely motivated and persistent adversary that constantly evolves tactics to infect their targets.<crlf>Organizations should remain vigilant against such threats, as they are likely to proliferate in the future. In-depth defense strategies based on a risk analysis approach can deliver the best results in the prevention. However, this should always be complemented by a good incident response plan which has been not only tested with tabletop exercises and reviewed and improved every time it's put to the test on real engagements.",

This new campaign from Transparent Tribe also saw fake installers for the Kavach application being used to deploy CrimsonRAT and other malware.<crlf>The use of CrimsonRAT in operations such as these is expected of Transparent Tribe. It has been seen in the wild for years and is the tool of choice for the threat actors in campaigns that cast a relatively wide net for targeting their victims. This is unlike ObliqueRAT, which is used in highly targeted operations by Transparent Tribe.<crlf>The use of new bespoke malware in addition to the RATs indicates the group is diversifying their malware portfolio to achieve an even greater degree of success. In another common trend, we have also observed Transparent Tribe quickly develop and deploy bespoke, small and lightweight stagers and downloaders that can be modified with relative ease (and discarded if needed), leading to the deployment of their actual implants meant to provide long term access into their targets' networks and systems.",

This new campaign from Transparent Tribe also saw fake installers for the Kavach application being used to deploy CrimsonRAT and other malware.<crlf>The use of CrimsonRAT in operations such as these is expected of Transparent Tribe. It has been seen in the wild for years and is the tool of choice for the threat actors in campaigns that cast a relatively wide net for targeting their victims. This is unlike ObliqueRAT, which is used in highly targeted operations by Transparent Tribe.<crlf>The use of new bespoke malware in addition to the RATs indicates the group is diversifying their malware portfolio to achieve an even greater degree of success. In another common trend, we have also observed Transparent Tribe quickly develop and deploy bespoke, small and lightweight stagers and downloaders that can be modified with relative ease (and discarded if needed), leading to the deployment of their actual implants meant to provide long term access into their targets' networks and systems.",

Transparent Tribe's multiple campaigns leveraging CrimsonRAT over the years indicate a steady evolution in the implant's capabilities.<crlf>ObliqueRAT is a C/C++-based implant discovered by Talos in early 2020. ObliqueRAT is primarily reserved for highly targeted attacks on government personnel and in operations where stealth is a prime focus of the attackers' infection chain. This implant has also seen a constant evolution in deployment tactics and malicious functionalities over time.<crlf>Custom malware used by Transparent Tribe consists of easily and quickly deployable downloaders, droppers and lightweight RATs containing limited capabilities as opposed to CrimsonRAT and ObliqueRAT.",

This campaign furthers this targeting and their central goal of establishing long term access for espionage. The use of multiple types of delivery vehicles and file formats indicates that the group is aggressively trying to infect their targets with their implants such as CrimsonRAT. They have continued the use of fake domains masquerading as government and quasi-government entities, as well as the use of generically themed content-hosting domains to host malware. Although not very sophisticated, this is an extremely motivated and persistent adversary that constantly evolves tactics to infect their targets.<crlf>Organizations should remain vigilant against such threats, as they are likely to proliferate in the future. In-depth defense strategies based on a risk analysis approach can deliver the best results in the prevention.

            "Although not very sophisticated, this is an extremely motivated and persistent adversary that constantly evolves tactics to infect their targets",
            "Organizations should remain vigilant against such threats, as they are likely to proliferate in the future"
