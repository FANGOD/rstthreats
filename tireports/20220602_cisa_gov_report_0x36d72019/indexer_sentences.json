Ensure copies of critical data are not accessible for modification or deletion from the system where the data resides. Install and regularly update antivirus software on all hosts and enable real time detection. Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as updates/patches are released. Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new or unrecognized accounts. Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls with least privilege in mind. Do not give all users administrative privileges. Disable unused ports. Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization. Disable hyperlinks in received emails. Enforce multi-factor authentication. Use National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) standards for developing and managing password policies.  Only use secure networks and avoid using public Wi-Fi networks. Consider installing and using a VPN. Focus on cyber security awareness and training. Regularly provide users with training on information security principles and techniques as well as overall emerging cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities (i.e., ransomware and phishing scams). Use longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64 characters in length; Store passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers; Add password user salts to shared login credentials; Avoid reusing passwords; Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts; Disable password hints; Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year. Note: NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password patterns cyber criminals can easily decipher. Require administrator credentials to install software."}
