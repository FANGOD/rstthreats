                        "Industroyer2 shares number of code similarities with the payload 104.dll of Industroyer. We assess with high confidence that the new variant was built using the same source code.",
                        "Industroyer2 only implements the IEC-104 (aka IEC 60870-5-104) protocol to communicate with industrial equipment. This includes protection relays, used in electrical substations. This is a slight change from the 2016 Industroyer variant that is a fully-modular platform with payloads for multiple ICS protocols.",
                        "Figure 5. Output produced by Industroyer2 malware (IP addresses redacted by ESET)",
                        "ESET researchers collaborated with CERT-UA to analyze the attack against the Ukrainian energy company<crlf>The destructive actions were scheduled for 2022-04-08 but artifacts suggest that the attack had been planned for at least two weeks<crlf>The attack used ICS-capable malware and regular disk wipers for Windows, Linux and Solaris operating systems<crlf>We assess with high confidence that the attackers used a new version of the Industroyer malware, which was used in 2016 to cut power in Ukraine<crlf>We assess with high confidence that the APT group Sandworm is responsible for this new attack",
                        "In 2017, ESET researchers revealed that a piece of malware that we named Industroyer was responsible for the power blackout that impacted Ukraines capital Kiev in December 2016.",
                        "Industroyer2 is highly configurable. It contains a detailed configuration hardcoded in its body, driving the malware actions. This is different from Industroyer, stores configuration in a separate .INI file. Thus, attackers need to recompile Industroyer2 for each new victim or environment. However, given that the Industroyer* malware family has only been deployed twice, with a five year gap between each version, this is probably not a limitation for Sandworm operators.",
                        "Industroyer2 was deployed as a single Windows executable named 108_100.exe and executed using a scheduled task on 2022-04-08 at 16:10:00 UTC. It was compiled on 2022-03-23, according to the PE timestamp, suggesting that attackers had planned their attack for more than two weeks.",
                        "As detailed in our white paper Win32/Industroyer: A new threat for industrial control systems, it is capable of interacting with industrial control systems typically found in electric power systems. This includes IEC-101, IEC-104, IEC 61850 and OPC DA devices.",
                        "Ukraine is once again at the center of cyberattacks targeting their critical infrastructure. This new Industroyer campaign follows multiple waves of wipers that have been targeting various sectors in Ukraine. ESET researchers will continue to monitor the threat landscape in order to better protect organizations from these types of destructive attacks.",
                        "In addition to Industroyer2, Sandworm used several destructive malware families including CaddyWiper, ORCSHRED, SOLOSHRED and AWFULSHRED. We first discovered CaddyWiper on 2022-03-14 when it was used against a Ukrainian bank see our Twitter thread about CaddyWiper. A variant of CaddyWiper was used again on 2022-04-08 14:58 against the Ukrainian energy provider previously mentioned.",
                        "Like the Linux variant, the malicious script iterates over all services to stop and disable them if they contain the keyword ssh, http, apache and additionally ora_ or oracle. Those services are very likely used by applications used to control ICS systems. Wiping them would prevent the energy companys operators from retaking control of the substations and roll back Industroyer2 actions.",
                        "Figure 4. Hardcoded configuration found in Industroyer2 sample",
                        "The collaboration resulted in the discovery of a new variant of Industroyer malware, which we together with CERT-UA named Industroyer2 see CERT-UA publication here. Industroyer is an infamous piece of malware that was used in 2016 by the Sandworm APT group to cut power in Ukraine.",
                        "In this case, the Sandworm attackers made an attempt to deploy the Industroyer2 malware against high-voltage electrical substations in Ukraine.",
                        "The new configuration format is stored as a string which is then supplied to the IEC-104 communication routine of the malware. Industroyer2 is able to communicate with multiple devices at once. Specifically, the analyzed sample contains eight different IP addresses of devices see Figure 4.",
                        "The recently discovered malware is a new variant of Industroyer, hence the name Industroyer2.",
                        "At that time, we said that it seems very unlikely anyone could write and test such malware without access to the specialized equipment used in the specific, targeted industrial environment. This was confirmed in 2020 by the United States government when six officers of the Russian Military Unit 74455 of the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), were indicted for their role in multiple cyberattacks including Industroyer and NotPetya see the indictment on justice.gov and our historical overview of Sandworms operations.",

                        "Industroyer2 can produce a log file or output its progress to the console window. However, instead of meaningful text messages as in the previous version, the malware writes various error codes see Figure 5. We believe it is an obfuscation attempt by Sandworm developers to hamper analysis.",
                        "In coordination with the deployment of Industroyer2 in the ICS network, the attackers deployed a new version of the CaddyWiper destructive malware. We believe it was intended to slow down the recovery process and prevent operators of the energy company from regaining control of the ICS consoles. It was also deployed on the machine where Industroyer2 was executed, likely to cover their tracks.",
                        "ARGUEPATCH was executed by a scheduled task that was intended to be launched once on 2022-04-08 14:58 UTC on one machine and at 16:20 UTC on the machine where Industroyer2 was deployed."

This is different from Industroyer, stores configuration in a separate .INI file. Thus, attackers need to recompile Industroyer2 for each new victim or environment.

It was deployed via Group Policy Object (GPO), indicating the attackers had prior control of the targets network beforehand. The wiper erases user data and partition information from attached drives, making the system inoperable and unrecoverable.",

This erases extended information of the drives partitions: the Master boot record (MBR) or the GUID Partition Table (GPT). This renders the machine unbootable.",

ARGUEPATCH is a patched version of a legitimate component of Hex-Rays IDA Pro software, specifically the remote IDA debugger server win32_remote.exe. IDA Pro is not intended to be used in an ICS environment, as its main purpose is for software reverse-engineering including malware analysis. We dont know why attackers chose to trojanize this piece of software; it might be a troll towards defenders.",

We believe it was intended to slow down the recovery process and prevent operators of the energy company from regaining control of the ICS consoles. It was also deployed on the machine where Industroyer2 was executed, likely to cover their tracks.",

The worm is not launched with the owner argument, so the wiper is scheduled to launch at 2:58pm UTC and destroy all data. If those systems were set to the local time zone, the destruction mustve started at the same time as the system compromised with CaddyWiper.",

This is different from Industroyer, stores configuration in a separate .INI file. Thus, attackers need to recompile Industroyer2 for each new victim or environment. However, given that the Industroyer* malware family has only been deployed twice, with a five year gap between each version, this is probably not a limitation for Sandworm operators.",

ARGUEPATCH is a patched version of a legitimate component of Hex-Rays IDA Pro software, specifically the remote IDA debugger server win32_remote.exe. IDA Pro is not intended to be used in an ICS environment, as its main purpose is for software reverse-engineering including malware analysis. We dont know why attackers chose to trojanize this piece of software; it might be a troll towards defenders.",

A variant of CaddyWiper was used again on 2022-04-08 14:58 against the Ukrainian energy provider previously mentioned."
