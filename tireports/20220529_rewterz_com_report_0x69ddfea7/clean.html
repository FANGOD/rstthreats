<h2>Analysis Summary</h2>
<p>HawkEye, primarily an infostealer, has additional capabilities such as bypassing of AV systems and keylogging. A spear-phishing campaign is detected using malicious RTF documents sent via corona-themed emails to distribute the HawkEye keylogger. While most malicious RTF documents use exploits to trigger Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) calls, in this case, the documents use the \objupdate switch. A victim would need to enable macros for the infection process to begin. The embedded OLE objects, five of them in this case, appear to be macro-enabled Excel sheets. PowerShell is used to execute .NET code which downloads and executes the Hawkeye payload.</p>
