                        "It is unclear why the threat actor made the particular modifications to INDUSTROYER.V2. Perhaps the actor wanted to develop a more streamlined version to target a very specific environment, or they did not want to expose more valuable or capable tools, or they simply believed this approach would be efficient since it would not require additional resources to impact the target.",
                        "Figure 5: INDUSTROYER.V2 message sequence with emulated IEC-104 Remote Station",
                        "As shown by the details embedded in the malware configurations, the actor conducted at least some internal network reconnaissance to identify specific IEDs in the victim environments and understand how to access them.<crlf>The malware configurations target devices across specific subnets, highlighting that the actor succeeded in identifying and penetrating surrounding networks.<crlf>The actors successful implementation of IEC-104 to interact with the targeted devices indicates a robust understanding of the protocol and knowledge of the victim environment. For example, in the samples we analyzed the actor manipulated a selected list of Information Object Addresses (IOAs), which are used to interact with power line switches or circuit breakers in a remote terminal unit (RTU) or relay configuration.<crlf>Conversely, the malware code itself shows some degree of carelessness or potential time constraints. For example, the INDUSTROYER.V2 samples contain limited obfuscation and defense evasion methods. The lack of obfuscation in the binaries provides defenders with quick hints on its functionality and ability to target OT assets.",
                        "If you need support responding to related activity, please contact Mandiant Consulting. Further analysis of related threatsincluding additional malware that was deployed alongside INDUSTROYER.V2is available as part of Mandiant Advantage Threat Intelligence.",
                        "Figure 5 illustrates the described message sequence, captured between INDUSTROYER.V2 and a lab emulated IEC-104 remote station. It displays the initial TESTFR, STARTDT, and Interrogation commands, followed by the crafted ASDU commands delivered to specific remote station IOAs.",
                        "After the command line interface arguments are parsed, INDUSTROYER.V2 iterates through embedded configuration entries. The execution of the program is highly configurable. Based on our analysis of two INDUSTROYER.V2 samples, the malware contains configuration entries structured as strings in the order shown in Table 1.",
                        "Regardless of the motivations, the reuse of code from known OT malware highlights the value of hunting and detections based on known indicators. For instance, some detections we built for the original INDUSTROYER successfully identified INDUSTROYER.V2 in the wild. While it is often believed that OT malware is not likely to be utilized in more than one environment, tools that take advantage of insecure by design OT featuressuch as INDUSTROYER.V2 doescan be employed multiple times to target multiple victims. The OT security community should recognize these tools as frameworks or capabilities, and not merely features of isolated cyber security incidents and one time use tools.",
                        "For example, both INDUSTROYER versions use very similar code to parse APDU traffic and print specific parsed fields. Figure 6 is a screenshot of INDUSTROYER.V2 on the left and on the right a screenshot of the original INDUSTROYER.",
                        "While much of the story surrounding INDUSTROYER.V2s deployment is already publicly available, Mandiant further analyzed the malware to share additional insights for defenders and the OT community. In this blog post we document additional technical details of INDUSTROYER.V2 based on our analysis of two different samples. We also provide detection rules to identify related activity.",
                        "Figure 1: Example INDUSTROYER.V2 configuration for publicly available sample",
                        "INDUSTROYER.V2 is similar to its predecessor, however this variant contains more targeted functionality. Unlike the original INDUSTROYER, which was a framework that leveraged external modules to implement four different OT protocols, this variant is self-contained and only implements the IEC 60870-5-104 (IEC-104) communications protocol. IEC-104 is used for power system monitoring and control over TCP and is mainly implemented in Europe and the Middle East.",
                        "INDUSTROYER.V2 first sends control function messages, which are contained within an APCI frame. The first control message is a Test Frame (TESTFR). The malware sends a TESTFR ACT to the remote station which verifies an established connection. If one exists, a remote station responds with a corresponding TESTFR CON.",
                        "The attack is significant not only because OT-targeted attacks are rare, but also because this is the first instance in which code from broadly known attack-oriented OT malware was redeployed against a new victim. Despite five years of substantial analysis into INDUSTROYER from a variety of researchers, the actor still attempted to repurpose the tool and customized it to reach new targets. INDUSTROYER.V2 (Mandiants name for the new variant) reinforces the notion that OT malware can be tailored for use against multiple victims, which has serious implications for other publicly known OT malware families like INCONTROLLER.",
                        "After parsing each configuration entry, INDUSTROYER.V2 enumerates running processes to identify if a specific hard-coded process is running and terminates it. Once this process is stopped, the malware enumerates running processes again and terminates whichever process is specified by the operator in the configuration.",
                        "We believe both samples are related to the same operation. The compilation timestamps were within minutes of each other and about two weeks before the intended attack. It is possible the actor was modifying the malwares configuration to customize the payload for different targets.<crlf>Each sample contains different configurations hardcoded within the binary. One sample contains eight unique hardcoded target IP addresses, whereas the other only contains three.<crlf>In both samples the malware terminated a specific process. However, the defined filepath used to concatenate with the process differed between the two samples. This shows a nuanced understanding of the victim environment.<crlf>Figure 1 shows an example of INDUSTROYER.V2 configuration for the publicly available sample.",
                        "Extensible frameworks, such as the original INDUSTROYER and INCONTROLLER, are often preferred by threat actors due to the flexibility of their modular design, allowing deployment of specific payloads to target different victim assets or communication protocols. However, in the case of INDUSTROYER.V2, the actor reimplemented only one of the original components from the earlier framework and created a new self-contained executable.",
                        "The two versions of INDUSTROYER contain overlaps in code and similarities in execution flow and functionality. We identified the following shared features in execution and functionality:",
                        "On April 12, 2022, CERT-UA and ESET reported that a cyber physical attack impacted operational technology (OT) supporting power grid operations in Ukraine. The attack leveraged different pieces of malware including a variant of INDUSTROYER, a well-known piece of attack-oriented ICS malware originally deployed in December 2016 to cause power outages in Ukraine.",
                        "Figure 6: APDU traffic handling in INDUSTROYER.V2 (Left) and INDUSTROYER.104 (Right)",
                        "In this status, 50 is the ANSI number for circuit breaker, which is how relay elements are numbered when setting a protection relay. Then 50BFT stands for circuit breaker failure protection. We provide an appendix illustrating additional mapping of IOAs extracted from the configuration of the public INDUSTROYER.V2 sample against the same distribution recloser relay.",
                        "INDUSTROYER.V2 is written in C++ and implements the IEC-104 protocol to modify the state of remote terminal units (RTUs) over TCP. IEC-104 protocol TCP clients are called control stations and the TCP servers are called remote stations. The malware crafts configurable IEC-104 Application Service Data Unit (ASDU) messages, also known as telegrams, to change the state of a remote stations Information Object Addresses (IOAs) to ON or OFF. IOAs identify a specific data element on a device and may correspond to power line switches or circuit breakers in an RTU or relay configuration.",
                        "One difference we identified between both variants is that, unlike its predecessor, INDUSTROYER.V2 contains altered debugging messages which obfuscate the meaning of the outputs. However, we note these debugging messages are formatted and printed at similar execution points of key functions. Further, the obfuscation was not implemented in key portions of IEC-104 code which are reused in both versions, which enables us to visualize the overlaps.",
                        "Most importantly, the new malware variant enables the actor to embed customized configurations that modify the malwares behavior to specific intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) (e.g., protection relays, merging units, etc.) within the target environment. The design change to embed custom configurations in INDUSTROYER.V2 reduces the effort required by the actor to reproduce the attack against different victim environments and enables the actor to contain the impact to specific targeted IEDs.",
                        "To fully understand the implications of the new customization capabilities in INDUSTROYER.V2, we analyzed and compared two different samples. The second sample, which is likely a recompiled version, is publicly available and in online malware scanning platforms (MD5: 7c05da2e4612fca213430b6c93e76b06)."
