For example, in the samples we analyzed the actor manipulated a selected list of Information Object Addresses (IOAs), which are used to interact with power line switches or circuit breakers in a remote terminal unit (RTU) or relay configuration. Conversely, the malware code itself shows some degree of carelessness or potential time constraints. For example, the INDUSTROYER.V2 samples contain limited obfuscation and defense evasion methods.
