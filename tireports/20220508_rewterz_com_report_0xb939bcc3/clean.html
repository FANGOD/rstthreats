<h2>Analysis Summary</h2>
<p>Docker Engine honeypots were compromised by Ukraine supports, most likely the Ukraine IT Army, in attacks against Belarusian and Russian websites. DOS (denial-of-service) were conducted on Russian websites by compromising exposed Docker Engine API. The first image “abagayev/stop-russia” was downloaded around 100,000 times.</p>
<p>“Container and cloud-based resources are being abused to deploy disruptive tools. The use of compromised infrastructure has far-reaching consequences for organizations who may unwittingly be participating in hostile activity against Russian government, military and civilian targets.” <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/compromised-docker-honeypots-used-for-pro-ukrainian-dos-attack/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> Security Researchers. “Docker Engine honeypots were compromised to execute two different Docker images targeting Russian, Belarusian and Lithuanian websites in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.”</p>
