The campaign is characterized as an espionage campaign aiming to steal sensitive information from PCs and mobile devices belonging to a chosen target group of Israeli individuals working for law enforcement, military and emergency services.\nAttribution to APT-C-23: Based on our investigation and previous knowledge of the group, Cybereason assesses with moderate-high confidence that the group behind the new campaign is APT-C-23, an Arabic-speaking, politically motivated group believed to be operating on behalf of Hamas.\nSocial Engineering as Primary Infection Vector: The attackers used fake Facebook profiles to trick specific individuals into downloading trojanized direct message applications for Android and PC, which granted them access to the victims devices.\nUpgraded Malware Arsenal: The new campaign consists of two previously undocumented malware, dubbed Barb(ie) Downloader and BarbWire Backdoor, both of which use an enhanced stealth mechanism to remain undetected. In addition, Cybereason observed an upgraded version of an Android implant dubbed VolatileVenom.\nAPT-C-23 Stepping Up Their Game: Until recently, the group has been using known tools which served them for years, and were known for their relatively unsophisticated tools and techniques. The analysis of this recent campaign shows that the group has revamped their toolset and playbook."

As mentioned above, in the infection phase the downloader is delivered alongside a video in a .rar file. The video is meant to distract the victim from the infection process that is happening in the background.\nThe downloader sample analyzed in this section is named Windows Notifications.exe. When first executed, Barb(ie) decrypts strings using a custom base64 algorithm that is also used in the BarbWire backdoor. Those decrypted strings are different Virtual Machine vendor names, WMI queries, command and control (C2), file and folders names which are used in different phases of the execution.\nOne way the malware uses those strings is in performing multiple checks, such as anti-vm and anti-analysis checks, in order to determine that the coast is clear. If the check fails, a custom pop-up message is displayed to the user and the malware terminates itself:\nCustom pop-up displayed to user before terminating process: Unable to start program 'http:/localhost:60721/\nIf the malware finds the target machine to be clean and it doesnt detect any sandboxing or other analysis being performed on the targeted device, the malware will continue its execution and collect information about the machine, including username, computer name, date and time, running processes and OS version.\nLater, the malware will attempt to create a connection to the embedded C2 server: fausto-barb[.]website. When creating the connection, the malware sends information about the victim machine that is composed of the data collected. In addition, it sends other information to the C2, like the OS version, downloader name and compilation month (windowsNotification + 092021) as well as information on any installed Antivirus software running:\nC2 server for Barb(ie) downloader\nData sent back to the C2 over http\nBarb(ie) will attempt to download the payload by using the following URI: /api/sofy/pony:\nURI structure for Barb(ie) downloader\nIn addition, the downloader creates a file named adbloker.dat that stores the encrypted C2, copies itself to programdata and sets persistence via two scheduled tasks: 01 and 02.\nInterestingly, another Barb(ie) sample that was analyzed with a different name (Windows Security.exe) copies itself to appdata as well, but renames the executable to Windows Notifications.exe and sets the same persistence:\nTwo scheduled tasks created by Barb(ie) downloader for persistence\nExecution of the Barb(ie) downloader as shown in the Cybereason XDR Platform\nLooking at the metadata of Windows Notifications.exe, it appears that the author of the malware chooses a unique company name and product name that do not exist as part of Windows: Windows Security Groups as the company name, and Windows Essential as product name:\nMetadata of the Barb(ie) downloader as shown in the Cybereason XDR Platform\nOnce a successful connection has been established with the C2, Barb(ie) will download the payload, the BarbWire backdoor."

The campaign featured a classic social engineering tactic known as catfishing, where the group used sexual content in order to lure their victims, mostly Israeli men, into downloading malware.\nCybereason assesses with moderate-high confidence that APT-C-23, a politically-motivated APT group that operates on behalf of Hamas, is behind the campaign detailed in this report. While the APT-C-23 operations against Arab-speaking targets (mostly Palestinians) are still taking place, this newly identified campaign specifically targets Israelis and shows unique characteristics that distinguish it from other campaigns. The attackers use a completely new infrastructure that is distinct from the known infrastructure used to target Palestinians and other Arabic-speakers. In addition, all three malware in use were also specifically designed to be used against Israeli targets, and were not observed being used against other targets.\nThe Cybereason investigation found that some victims were infected with both PC and Android malware dubbed Barb(ie) Downloader, BarbWire Backdoor, and VolatileVenom. This tight grip on their targets attests to how important and sensitive this campaign was for the threat actors.\nLastly, this campaign shows a considerable step-up in APT-C-23 capabilities, with upgraded stealth, more sophisticated malware, and perfection of their social engineering techniques which involve offensive HUMINT capabilities using a very active and well-groomed network of fake Facebook accounts that have been proven quite effective for the group.\nCybereason contacted Facebook and reported the fake accounts."
