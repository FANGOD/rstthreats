For the last few years, Joakim has been researching malware written in Go. To make the analysis easier he has written the Go Reverse Engineering Toolkit (github.com/goretk), an open-source toolkit for analysis of Go binaries.",
                        "Two of these components were first reported on by the Computer Emergency Response Team for Ukraine (CERT-UA) in March 2022. They named the two components GraphSteel and GrimPlant. When investigating these events, we have identified that Elephant has also been delivered via phishing emails from spoofed Ukrainian email addresses. Elephant is a malware framework written in Go. The activity has been attributed to UAC-0056 (TA471, SaintBear, UNC2589) by CERT-UA.",
                        "The credentials on the machine are stolen using code lifted from goLazagne. In addition to stealing credentials, the malware will look in the users Documents, Downloads, Pictures, and Desktop folder for files with the file-extensions listed in the snippet below.",
                        "UAC-0056 (TA471, SaintBear, UNC2589) started using a new malware framework called Elephant back in December 2021. The malware has been delivered in targeted spear phishing campaigns using spoofed Ukrainian governmental email addresses. The malware consists of at least four different components that are used for stealing credentials, documents, and to provide remote access to the infected machine. The threat actor has opted to use multiple protocols for C2 communication, gRPC and GraphQL over websockets. This is an interesting choice as it complicates the development of the framework with more code to maintain.",
                        "The client component is a credential and file stealer. It communicates with the C2 server over WebSockets to a GraphQL endpoint. All the messages are encrypted with AES. The key is received from the C2 server. The malware author has written their own RSA implementation for the key exchange that is used to receive the shared secret. All messages prior to the key exchange, including the key exchange itself, are encrypted with AES using a hardcoded key.",
                        "The downloader acts as an orchestrator for the other components. In addition to downloading the client and the implant components, it also sets up persistence and can perform updates. Like all the other components, before any malicious activity is taken it performs some evasion techniques. The difference between this component and the others is that this one is using code from the ColdFire project on GitHub. The screenshot below shows the malware using the Wait function to sleep for 10 seconds before allocating 200 mb of garbage data.",
                        "After a successful authentication, it sends a heartbeat message every 10 seconds. This message includes information about the infected machine: public IP address, hostname, username, etc. In addition to the heartbeat message, the malware starts the command loop that checks for new commands to execute every 3 seconds. If a command is received it executes it by spawning a PowerShell instance by executing %windir%\\SysWOW64\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe and returns the result to the C2 server.",
                        "Using the embedded CA certificate in the malware, we uncovered older service certificates and IP addresses. The oldest certificate we discovered had a validity date of not before December 9th, 2021. The IP address of the server where this certificate was served from is owned by the Russian hosting provider Zservers and still returned Elephant components as of April 2022. The components retrieved from the server are very similar to the samples used at the end of March. The other hosting providers used by the threat actor are PQ Hosting and Serverion.",
                        "A recently developed malware framework called Elephant is being delivered in targeted spear phishing campaigns using spoofed Ukrainian governmental email addresses.

The emails that target UA have the same subject and use the same attached xls file that delivers the first malicious payload.",
                        "The malware that is dropped by the phishing lure is the dropper component of what we call the Elephant Framework. The framework consists of four components that work in unison. The code snippet below shows a reconstruction of the source code tree, bold indicating folders, showing how the different components have been organized. The location of the implants entrypoint is unknown and has been guessed to be in the root folder. As there are also server components to the framework, we hypothesize that there are more folders for the two servers used by the framework.",
                        "GrimPlant communicates with the C2 server over gRPC. The communication is encrypted with TLS. The malware has an embedded root certificate that it uses to verify that it talks to a trusted server. The code snippet shows parts of the root certificate information. The certificate used by the C2 server has been signed by this root certificate which allows the threat actor to rotate the certificate without redeploying a new malware.",
                        "GrimPlant is a backdoor that allows the operator to execute arbitrary PowerShell scripts on the infected machine. The backdoor has a relatively small set of functionality, for example it doesnt have any persistence functionality on its own. When the malware first is executed, it allocates 200 mb and sleeps for 10 seconds, the function shown in the screenshot below. This is an anti-emulation technique that has been found in other malware written in Go.",
                        "The downloader has some 3rd party libraries, whose metadata are listed in the binary, that are not used. All the 3rd party libraries are listed in the code snippet below. In the list for example port-scanner, gopacket, and gateway packages are not being used. These are all libraries to facilitate lateral movement. It is not clear if these are left-overs from an older version of the malware or hints of future functionality.",
                        "There are only a handful of gRPC methods supported by the malware. A reconstructed protobuf specification is shown in the code snippet below. To identify which instance of the malware is sending the request to the C2 server, the malware uses its machine ID as an unique identifier in the messages. When the malware first connects to the C2 server, it authenticates itself with the password sdrunlygvhwbcaeiuklgunvre.",
                        "Persistence is established by adding a new key entry with the name Java-3DK to the registry key Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. After this, the malware checks if a new binary exists by comparing its MD5 hash with a hash from the server. If no update is needed, it downloads the other two components.",
                        "On March 15, SentinelOne found two more samples of the GraphSteel and GrimPlant malware families. These samples written in Go were dropped by an executable that was disguised as a translation application. The new samples are similar to those published by the CERT-UA, both in the naming and the functionality.",

The attached file had macros that, once executed, created a file called Base-Update.exe a malware that downloads and executes two other files classified as GraphSteel and GrimPlant by the CERT.",

The address is not provided as a plain string. Instead it has been encrypted with AES in Cipher-Block Chaining (CBC) mode.
