Spear-phishing emails are used to encourage victims to open a malicious Microsoft Excel/Word document. All of the Excel droppers found were using a technique that leverages formulae in hidden spreadsheets or cells to execute macro 4.0 commands named as Excel 4.0 macros. It is used to drop malware called Ferocious droppers. The payload was downloaded using conventional VBA macros by the Word droppers. The actor customized the counterfeit contents to the targeted victims, including logos and themes that were relevant to the targeted company or current events in their location. However, in some circumstances a bogus Kaspersky Update Agent executable worked as a dropper for the VBS implant. The threat actor appears to have targeted a range of sectors, including diplomatic and financial institutions, government, law firms, military groups, and technological enterprises. Armenia, Cyprus, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, and Turkey are among the countries affected. WIRTE is a suspected part of the Gaza Cybergang that is an Arabic politically motivated cyber criminal group. WIRTE APT Subgroup changed their toolkit and how they operate in order to be inconspicuous for longer. They use simple but successful tactics to compromise its victims and outperformed its suspected peers in terms of OpSec by using interpreted language malwares like VBS and PowerShell scripts."}
