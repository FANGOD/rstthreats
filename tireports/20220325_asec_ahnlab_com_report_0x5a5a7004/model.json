It appears that all three files are properly created Word files containing malicious macro codes, and seeing how the text is related to cryptocurrency, the attacker must have been targeting cryptocurrency companies. All the Word files were modified by an author named Acer, and seeing how they were modified on the morning of March 21st, the files may be used when the attacker launches their attack.
