<div> Threat Spotlight: Conti Ransomware Group Behind the Karakurt Hacking Team <h1>Threat Spotlight: Conti Ransomware Group Behind the Karakurt Hacking Team</h1> <h2><a id="post-8630-_Toc100251966"></a>Report Summary</h2> <p>In this report we would like to share the strong connection between two notorious Cyber Threat Actors called Conti and Karakurt. Both of them worked for the same end result and it is the ransom money. The Infinitum IT Cyber Threat Intelligence team successfully monitored one of the key members of Conti Ransomware group, at this stage we don’t want to disclose the nickname of the group member but we will share details about how the connection between two cyber threat groups occurred, tactics and techniques used by Karakurt hacking team and details about internal infrastructure of Conti / Karakurt.</p> <p> </p> <p>Infinitum IT Cyber Threat Intelligence team able to obtain remote access on multiple servers, they are being actively used by members of threat actors as command and control server, storage server that have stolen private data from various victims and web server that is being used by Karakurt Hacking team as a blog page. Threat actors like Ransomware group used their web pages to share large numbers of exfiltrate data that are being stolen from victims, they are using data to threaten the victim companies to pay the ransom money.</p> <img alt="Timeline" class="wp-image-8669 size-full nitro-lazy" height="1536" id="Mzg1OjI5Mg==-1" src="" style="max-width:800px;height:auto;width:auto;" width="2048"/><p>Timeline</p> <p>All of the data in this report has been shared with the Government authorized, to help them in further investigation. The data from Command and Control Servers will be used for preventing future cyber attacks and help various organizations across the globe, in this report we shared TTP and IOC list that contains analyzed data that is coming from attackers internal servers. Our main goal is to help the victims of these attacks and prevent the feutre cyber attacks against various institutions and organizations.</p> <h2 class="nitro-offscreen"><a id="post-8630-_egvy60odhxgs"></a><a id="post-8630-_Toc100251967"></a>Information About Karakurt (Russian: Каракурт) Threat Actors</h2> <p>Karakurt is a well known threat actor group that has launched cyberattack against several Canadian and US organizations. On December 29, 2021, the Karakurt group claimed on its website that it had struck 11 organizations as part of its “Winter Data Leak Digest.” Of the 11, six were based in Canada. The group claimed to have compromised more than 40 victims between September and November 2021, sharing the stolen files on its name and shame blog website.</p> <p>Karakurt focuses exclusively on the Data Exfiltration, they are not using Ransomware to encrypt victims files. The group accomplishes this by first using VPN credentials to access victims’ networks, through phishing attacks against victims.</p> <p><img class="wp-image-8635 nitro-lazy" height="1418" id="MzkwOjE0MQ==-1" src="" style="max-width:800px;height:auto;width:auto;" width="1999"/></p> <p>Blog web page used by Karakurt team (karakurt[.]co)</p> <p>Karakurt had previously employed the Cobalt Strike remote access tool, but we also observed that it had since switched to using AnyDesk. Afterwards, the group steals additional credentials from administrators by using the password-stealing tool Mimikatz and Active Directory enumeration tool called ADfind. No ransomware is employed at any stage of the attacks, but the group uses the threat of leaking the stolen data for its ransom demands.</p> <p>We also observed that attackers use Mega upload accounts to store large volumes of stolen data.</p> <h2 class="nitro-offscreen"><a id="post-8630-_yiatbrnf5bma"></a><a id="post-8630-_Toc100251968"></a>Tactic and Techniques Used by Karakurt Hacking Team</h2> <h3 class="nitro-offscreen"><a id="post-8630-_rigbnmp0cuk"></a><a id="post-8630-_Toc100251969"></a>MITRE ATT&amp;CK Table</h3> <table class="nitro-offscreen"> <tbody> <tr> <td>Tactic</td> <td> Technique </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Initial Access</td> <td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133/">T1133: External Remote Services</a><p></p> <p><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/">T1078: Valid Accounts</a></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Execution</td> <td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/">T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter</a><p></p> <p><a href="https://www.picussecurity.com/resource/blog/picus-10-critical-mitre-attck-techniques-t1086-powershell">T1086: PowerShell</a></p> <p><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/002/">T1035: Service Execution</a></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Persistence</td> <td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003/">T1050: New Service</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Defense Evasion</td> <td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/">T1078: Valid Accounts</a><p></p> <p><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/">T1036: Masquerading</a></p> <p><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/">T1027: Obfuscated Files or Information</a></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Credential Access</td> <td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/">T1110: Brute Force</a><p></p> <p><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/">T1003: Credential Dumping</a></p> <p><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/001/">T1557.001: LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay</a></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Discovery</td> <td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/">T1083: File and Directory Discovery</a><p></p> <p><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/">T1082: System Information Discovery</a></p> <p><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/">T1087: Account Discovery</a></p> <p><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1135/">T1135: Network Share Discovery</a></p> <p><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1069/">T1069: Permission Groups Discovery</a></p> <p><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1018/">T1018: Remote System Discovery</a></p> <p><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016/">T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery</a></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Lateral Movement</td> <td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001/">T1021.001: Remote Desktop Protocol</a><p></p> <p><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/006/">T1021.006: Windows Remote Management</a></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Collection</td> <td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005/">T1005: Data from Local System</a><p></p> <p><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1039/">T1039: Data from Network Shared Drive</a></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Command &amp; Control</td> <td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1436/">T1436: Commonly Used Port</a><p></p> <p><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105/">T1105: Remote File Copy</a></p> <p><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/">T1071: Standard Application Layer Protocol</a></p> <p><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572/">T1572: Protocol Tunneling</a></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Exfiltration</td> <td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105/">T1002: Data Compressed</a><p></p> <p><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048/">T1048: Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol</a></p></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 class="nitro-offscreen"><a id="post-8630-_ojmfbjsgizt5"></a><a id="post-8630-_Toc100251970"></a>Internal Infrastructure Used by Conti and Karakurt Group</h2> <p>At the beginning of Conti leak in February 27, 2022 we are able to get inside multiple Protonmail and Mega Upload accounts used by one of the key members of Conti Ransomware group, after further investigation we observed threat actors used multiple Protonmail accounts for OPSEC reason,we are able to archived the content of mail traffic and we observed multiple email coming from Russian VPS Service called Inferno solutions, we got remote access on one of the Windows VPS Server that being used data storage system. That has more than 20 TB+ of stolen victim data.</p> <p><img class="wp-image-8637 nitro-lazy" height="1087" id="NDY1OjE0MQ==-1" src="" style="max-width:800px;height:auto;width:auto;" width="1999"/></p> <p>Proton mail account used by key member of Conti Ransomware group</p> <p><img class="wp-image-8639 nitro-lazy" height="1128" id="NDY3OjE0MQ==-1" src="" style="max-width:800px;height:auto;width:auto;" width="1999"/></p> <p>VPS Server Admin Panel</p> <h2 class="nitro-offscreen"><a id="post-8630-_uba6zpn7l7hh"></a><a id="post-8630-_Toc100251971"></a>Windows Data Storage Server Used by Conti Ransomware</h2> <p>Our first stage of analysis is this data storage server that is being used for storing large volumes of stolen data from victims. We can also observe that some of the data was old but not published publicly. We contact the victims to give their data back, on every Cyber Attacks we saw the usage of Mega Upload accounts to manage this overall 20TB+ data.</p> <p><img class="wp-image-8641 nitro-lazy" height="1428" id="NDcxOjE0MQ==-1" src="" style="max-width:800px;height:auto;width:auto;" width="1999"/></p> <p>During our investigation we observed that, Conti member used FileZilla to connect multiple remote servers, the main purpose is to upload the stolen data to another server for preparing the public release.</p> <p>When we take a closer look at the IP address 209[.]222[.]98[.]19 the DNS record shows us, it belongs to the karakurt[.]co blog page which it is being used for sharing the stolen files.During connection of remote server via FileZilla, Conti member don’t save any Password credentials, but Infinitum IT Cyber Threat Intelligence team successfully obtained the SSH Credentials via a 0day vulnerability affected by FileZilla and used this credentials to get inside the Command and Control Server.Attacker also used a SSH Private key to connect karakurt[.]co blog page, we also managed to obtained the private key.</p> <h2 class="nitro-offscreen"><a id="post-8630-_ns3j1oxuadjc"></a><a id="post-8630-_Toc100251972"></a>Karakurt Blog Web Server</h2> <p>When we connected to the Karakurt Blog Web Server, we saw that all of the stolen data had been categorized by a Software that was being developed by Karakurt members. During our analysis we are able to find an Admin Panel used by Karakurt and Server LOG data. Admin panel is being used for visualizing and filtering all stolen files.</p> <p><img class="wp-image-8643 nitro-lazy" height="866" id="NDc2OjE0MA==-1" src="" style="max-width:800px;height:auto;width:auto;" width="1999"/></p> <p>Web Server of karakurt[.]co</p> <p>The Infinitum IT Cyber Threat Intelligence team found this server also being used by the TOR network to serve itself on Darknet.</p> <p><img class="wp-image-8645 nitro-lazy" height="1014" id="NDc5OjE0MQ==-1" src="" style="max-width:800px;height:auto;width:auto;" width="1993"/></p> <p>All of the stolen data has been uploaded by multiple Karakurt members on one file called Work,this data then being categorized as public or not public. We can easily see the Karakurt hacker team being more interested in Financial data from victims’ devices.</p> <p>In this example, it tell us storing critical data in device without Encrypting can cause the mass data exfiltration.</p> <p><img class="wp-image-8647 nitro-lazy" height="1007" id="NDgyOjE0MQ==-1" src="" style="max-width:800px;height:auto;width:auto;" width="1962"/></p> <p>Inside the server directory we can observed source code of the Admin Panel.</p> <p><img class="wp-image-8649 nitro-lazy" height="1223" id="NDg0OjE0MQ==-1" src="" style="max-width:800px;height:auto;width:auto;" width="1999"/></p> <p>If we see the routing code developed in Ruby on Rails, we can identify the Admin panel file path on live Web Server.</p> <p><img class="wp-image-8651 nitro-lazy" height="1784" id="NDg2OjE0MQ==-1" src="" style="max-width:800px;height:auto;width:auto;" width="1999"/></p> <p>Ruby on Rails URL Routing</p> <p><img class="wp-image-8653 nitro-lazy" height="1261" id="NDg4OjE0MQ==-1" src="" style="max-width:800px;height:auto;width:auto;" width="1999"/></p> <p>Admin Panel used by Karakurt Hacking Team</p> <p>Overall storage capacity of karakurt[.]co</p> <p><img class="wp-image-8655 nitro-lazy" height="435" id="NDkxOjE0MA==-1" src="" style="max-width:800px;height:auto;width:auto;" width="1205"/></p> <h2 class="nitro-offscreen"><a id="post-8630-_uc63os7w8kpf"></a><a id="post-8630-_Toc100251973"></a>Command and Control Server</h2> <p>The Infinitum IT Cyber Threat Intelligence team is able to access the Command and Control Server that is being actively used by the Karakurt Hacking team on cyber attack operations. As a summary of the attack chain, we observed the use of open source tools like</p> <p><img class="wp-image-8657 nitro-lazy" height="1242" id="NDk0OjE0MQ==-1" src="" style="max-width:800px;height:auto;width:auto;" width="1999"/></p> <ul class="nitro-offscreen"> <li><a href="https://github.com/tnpitsecurity/ligolo-ng">Ligolo-ng</a> : Getting Initial Access on companies network via Reverse Tunneling, this technique being used for bypassing miss configured Firewall systems.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework">Metasploit</a> : Karakurt used Metasploit as C2 server and in post exploitation phase details can be seen on Metasploit log file that was obtained and shared by the Infinitum IT Cyber Threat Intelligence team on IOC part.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket">Impacket</a>: After getting Initial Access on the victim company network, Karakurt hacking team use Impacket to perform NTLM relay attacks.
