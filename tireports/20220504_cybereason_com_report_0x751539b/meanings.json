                        "Attribution to the Winnti APT Group: based on the analysis of the forensic artifacts, Cybereason estimates with medium-high confidence that the perpetrators of the attack are linked to the notorious Winnti APT group. This group has existed since at least 2010 and is believed to be operating on behalf of Chinese state interests and specializes in cyberespionage and intellectual property theft.",
                        "Researchers at Cybereason recently discovered such an attack, which was assessed to be the work of Chinese APT Winnti. Cybereason briefed the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Department of Justice (DOJ) on the investigation into the malicious campaign, which Cybereason researchers dubbed Operation CuckooBees.",
                        "The Winnti Group is one of the most prolific and successful threat actors in existence. Winnti has a history of attacks and campaigns supporting Chinese state-sponsored espionage activity and financially-motivated attacks.",
                        "Winnti Kill Chain as observed in Operation CuckooBees",
                        "Over the years, there have been multiple reports and US Department of Justice (DOJ) indictments tying Winnti to large-scale IP theft operations. Cybereason researchers believe that dozens of other companies were potentially affected by this or similar campaigns carried out by Winnti.",
                        "The Cybereason Nocturnus Team has published two reports related to Operation CuckooBees. For more on this campaign and the tactics, techniques, and processes used, check out Operation CuckooBees: Deep-Dive into Stealthy Winnti Techniques. For a detailed look at the malware toolkit employed in Operation CuckooBees, check out Operation CuckooBees: A Winnti Malware Arsenal Deep-Dive.",
                        "It is also hard to estimate the exact number of companies affected by Operation CuckooBees due to the complexity, stealth, and sophistication of the attacks. Winnti is one of the most industrious groups operating on behalf of Chinese state-aligned interests.",
                        "The Cybereason research agrees with that assessment. Operation CuckooBees offers a glimpse into the evolving Winnti intrusion playbook. Along with well-known and frequently used attacks, Cybereason researchers also witnessed unique evasive techniques.",
                        "Winnti leveraged both known and previously undocumented malware techniques, including digitally signed kernel-level rootkits. The threat employed an elaborate, multi-stage infection chain that was critical to enabling the group to remain undetected for so long.",

                        "Discovery of New Malware in the Winnti Arsenal: the reports expose previously undocumented malware strain called DEPLOYLOG used by the Winnti APT group and highlight new versions of known Winnti malware, including Spyder Loader, PRIVATELOG, and WINNKIT.<crlf>Rarely Seen Abuse of the Windows CLFS Feature: the attackers leveraged the Windows CLFS mechanism and NTFS transaction manipulations, which allowed them to conceal their payloads and evade detection by traditional security products.",

                        "Cybereason researchers attribute the intrusions and Operation CuckooBees with a moderate-to-high degree of confidence to the Winnti APT group. Winnti, also known as APT 41, BARIUM, and Blackfly, is a Chinese state-sponsored APT group known for its stealth, sophistication, and focus on stealing technology secrets.",
                        "Winnti is an exceptionally capable adversary. One report states, The groups distinct use of supply chain compromises to target select individuals, consistent use of compromised digital certificates, and deployment of bootkits (rare among APT operators), highlight a creative and well-resourced adversary."
