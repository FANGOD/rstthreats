<p>TL;DR – You can now subscribe to threat actors/malware families in Intezer and receive notifications for new IoCs and detection opportunities.</p>
<p>Staying on top of emerging threats and keeping your detection rules on track is challenging. To keep track, security teams have to continuously go over different reports, from different sources, for various threats. On top of that, these reports usually provide <a class="blog-text-link" href="http://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">low-pyramid IoCs</a> (file hashes, IPs, and domains), leaving more effective and longer-lasting <a class="blog-text-link" href="https://www.intezer.com/blog/threat-hunting/scale-incident-response-detection-engineering/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">detection opportunities</a> hidden. </p>
<p>To help you stay on top of emerging threats with the most updated detection rules, we have extended Intezer’s threat family tracking: </p>
<ul><li>Intezer’s <a class="blog-text-link" href="https://www.intezer.com/blog/threat-hunting/scale-incident-response-detection-engineering/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Detect &amp; Hunt feature</a> is now available per threat family. While the Detect &amp; Hunt tab has previously surfaced detection opportunities for a single file, now, it is possible to view aggregated IOCs/detection content for an entire threat actor or malware family. Detect &amp; Hunt allows you to extract high-quality IoCs and detection content (to use in your SIEM or EDR), quickly and effectively. This saves you time and effort in “fishing” for relevant artifacts from overwhelming sandbox reports.</li><li>Users can now track threats of interest and receive updates about new detection opportunities. </li></ul>
<p>On Intezer’s family page, you can find all the detection opportunities extracted per family. This capability, combined with our API, allows you to identify up-to-date behavioral artifacts to create rules to proactively hunt for the existence of a threat within your organization and create updated <a class="blog-text-link" href="https://www.intezer.com/blog/threat-hunting/intro-to-sigma-rules/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">detection rules</a>. You can “subscribe” to a threat family to ensure you do not miss the latest detection opportunities. </p>

<p>To accelerate the process of proactive and reactive threat hunting, you should make sure that you use high-quality detections and that you use automation where applicable. The detection opportunities Intezer provides are actionable and can be filtered based on an effectiveness pyramid that takes inspiration from the <a class="blog-text-link" href="http://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html">Pyramid of Pain</a>. All data is available via API to build automation around it.</p>
