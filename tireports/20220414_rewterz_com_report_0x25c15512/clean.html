<h2>Analysis Summary</h2>
<h4>CVE-2022-25622 CVSS: 5.3</h4>
<p>Siemens SIMATIC devices and Siemens SIMIT Simulation Platform are vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by uncontrolled resource consumption in the PROFINET (PNIO) stack when integrated with the Interniche IP stack. By sending specially-crafted TCP segments, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.</p>
<h4>CVE-2022-25650 CVSS: 3.1</h4>
<p>Siemens Mendix Applications could allow a remote authenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by improper access control when querying the database. By sorting the results using a protected field, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain the contents of a protected field.</p>
<h4>CVE-2022-25751 CVSS: 8.2</h4>
<p>Siemens SCALANCE X-300 series is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by improper validation of the HTTP headers of incoming requests. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the device to crash.</p>
<h4>CVE-2022-25752 CVSS: 8.8</h4>
<p>Siemens SCALANCE X-300 series could allow a remote attacker to hijack a user’s session, caused by the use of insufficiently random values in the webserver when calculating session ids and nonces. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to brute-force session ids and hijack existing sessions.</p>
<h4>CVE-2022-27194 CVSS: 7.5</h4>
<p>Siemens SIMATIC PCS neo, SINETPLAN, and TIA Portal are vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by improper validation of user requests sent to port 8888. By sending specially-crafted packets, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.</p>
<h4>CVE-2022-27241 CVSS: 5.3</h4>
<p>Siemens Mendix applications could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the exposure of the internal project structure. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information, and use this information to launch further attacks against the affected system.</p>
<h4>CVE-2022-27480 CVSS: 5.3</h4>
<p>Siemens SICAM A8000 CP-8050 and CP-8031 devices could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by missing authorization. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information, and use this information to launch further attacks against the affected system.</p>
