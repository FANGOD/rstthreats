For each file to encrypt, it generates an ECDH public-private key pair on the machine through Linuxs /dev/urandom. It then uses its embedded public key and the generated private key to create a secret key that will be used as a SOSEMANUK key. After encrypting the file, it will append the generated public key to it. Since the generated private key is not saved, one cannot use the embedded public key with the generated private key to produce the secret key. Therefore, decryption is only possible if the malicious actors private key is known. The infection chain is shown on Figure 5."}
