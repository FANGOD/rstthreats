Previous versions of the ransomware were written in C#. More recently, the authors redeveloped the ransomware using the Go programming language. The BlackByte Go variant was used in attacks described in an FBI advisory that warned BlackByte had compromised numerous businesses, including entities in US critical infrastructure sectors. In this post, Zscaler ThreatLabz analyzes two variants of the Go-based implementation of BlackByte ransomware."}

The threat group also performs double extortion attacks by stealing an organization's files and leaking them online if the ransom is not paid. The ransomware code itself is regularly updated to fix bugs, bypass security software, and hinder malware analysis. The encryption algorithms have also been improved to be more secure and prevent file recovery. This demonstrates that the threat group will likely continue to improve the ransomware and remain a significant threat to organizations."}

In this blog, for brevity, the Go-based BlackByte variant 1 will be referred to as BlackByte v1 and the second variant will be referred to as BlackByte v2."}
