LODEINFO was updated frequently, even in 2021. Since version 0.4.x, the launch method has been changed to LOLBAS (Living Off The Land Binaries And Scripts). Gh0stTimes is used by an attack group called BlackTech and equipped with a panel called Times. The code and functions are similar to the malware Gh0stRAT, which is also used by BlackTech.\nBy referring to the information published by JPCERT/CC, the speaker mentioned the restarted Emotet campaign and human-operated ransomware attacks as 2021's features in widespread attacks.\nSome of JPCERT/CCs public projects on GitHub were introduced at the end of the talk.

Another aspect of the attack was that Movable Type was used more concentratedly in Japan than in other regions, which resulted in the delay in the actions by foreign security vendors. Japanese local vendors therefore proactively collected and verified information as well as alerted users and provide measures. \nNext, the analysis of the following tools used in the vulnerability exploit was presented.\nFoxEx-Shell\nFoxWSO\nFoxWSO, downloaded by FoxEx-Shell, is a modified WSO (WebShell by Orb) which has features specific to FoxWSO compared to known WSOs. The speakers also added that AnonymousFox, an organisation allegedly selling FoxWSO, may have been involved in the attack as there were several posts from them offering the tool on Telegram."

Next, he shared and explained the trend of abused Japanese RESIPs, mainly from the following perspectives:\nPercentage of survival period for each IP address\nActive rate (number of days with suspicious activity/survival period) of IP addresses with long-term activity observed\nRatio of IP addresses per carrier\nTrends in access by unique users to each IP address\nFinally, he explained the verification results of fraud detection (spoofed login, unauthorized use of stolen cards, fraud). He compared the data collected in this research and those of fraud cases, and as a result, he found the followings:\nSimple IP address matching causes many false positives.\nFalse positives can be reduced to some extent by comparing the data with the time of malicious activities.\nIt is useful for determining whether an attacker uses Residential IP Proxy."

The speakers remarked that the exploitation of new vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2021-40444) and the distribution of Magniber through social engineering were the features of 2021.\nNext, a case study of the Magniber infection using Magnitude Exploit Kit and social engineering was described. When the kit was executed, a window asking for update appeared on Microsoft Edge. The malware was transmitted by downloading and installing AppX file (Windows Application Package) with a valid digital signature. The speakers also noted that Magniber has been updated to remove unnecessary features.\nIn the end, a few methods for investigating and detecting the Magnitude Exploit Kit and Magniber were presented based on their distinctive features."

It is necessary to pay attention because this tool can lead to ransomware infection just like before.\nRegarding EmoCheck, they said that the main purpose of developing it was to provide users with a tool to easily check for Emotet infection. They also explained the change in detection logic of EmoCheck. The first detection logic reproduced Emotets process, which selects multiple keywords for drive serials and set file names. Then, the logic was repeatedly updated as Emotet renewed its version and changed its processing logic.\nThey also explained about the obfuscation process implemented in EmoCheck to prevent Emotet developers from bypassing the detection logic of EmoCheck. They said that the latest version of EmoCheck (version 2.0) uses obfuscation methods same as or equivalent to those Emotet uses as follows.\nString Obfuscation\nMixed Boolean Arithmetic\nControl Flow Flattening\nWin32API Hashing Obfuscation\nFunction Argument Randomization\nEmoCheck\nhttps://github.com/JPCERTCC/EmoCheck"

The campaign has features such as using malvertising to infect them with Zloader malware eventually, and its attack methods have been frequently updated with new attack techniques.\nMalvertising used in this campaign is characterized by the landing page that appears after advertisement page displays a fake Java plug-in installation screen in the language of the targets country based on the geographic information of the IP address.\nIn addition, they said that the following campaigns are probably conducted by the same attack group since they are similar to Malsmoke in that they use malvertising and geographic information of IP address, etc.\nSeamless\nPseudoGate\nThey also explained the detection method of Malsmoke. They focused on the fact that Zloaders C2 server domains are generated by DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm), which does not change. They first collected Zloader samples from VirusTotal and other sources and then extracted Zloader configuration files with Triage, an online sandbox.\nBased on the information, they explained how DGA calculates the C2 server domains."

When communicating with the C2 server, the malware accesses a domain or URL that does not exist, and a part of the response data (NXDOMAIN) is used for a label that identifies WinDealer-infected devices. The label is used for a custom header when sending data to the C2 server. In addition, WinDealer uses IPGA (IP Generation Algorithm) to generate a random IP address from a specified range for C2 server to avoid tracking.\nThey also introduced an incident case of LuoYu. In this case, a legitimate application such as TIM (a communication tool) downloaded WinDealer, and then the device got infected with it. Finally, they described the results of threat analysis of the campaign using frameworks such as Diamond Model and MITRE ATT&CK."

The features, attack methods, and attack infrastructure of each type of malware were covered.\nCampaign 1: LAMICE, BUSYICE (a.k.a Flagpro), etc.\nCampaign 2: SLEFMAKE, SPIDERPIG\nHe first presented Campaign 1. The attack starts with a phishing email with the malware LAMICE attached. LAMICE drops BUSYICE and other type of malware, which then downloads new backdoors. He found that the way LAMICE generates a file name for the malware it drops is identical to that of Earth Hunduns TTP. In addition, he found connections and overlaps between the attack infrastructure of malware used by Earth Hundun, such as Gh0stTimes, and that of BUSYICE. For these reasons, he associated Campaign 1 with Earth Hundun.\nHe next presented Campaign 2. This campaign drops SELFMAKE through ProxyLogon, a vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server or via malware bundled installer. It eventually executes SPIDERPIG on memory. He found that the format of the Mutex strings created by SPIDERPIG and BUSYICE are similar, and he also observed a case where SPIDERPIG was dropped from LAMICE in November 2021. For these reasons, he concluded that the attack groups of Campaign 1 and 2 are probably the same and therefore that Campaign 2 is Earth Hundun.\nFinally, he explained that in the future, it will be important to continuously disclose the process of attribution and redefine attack groups in order to keep up with attacker groups, which keep changing by sharing attack tools with other groups."

The following new attack methods that they confirmed after JSAC2021 were also introduced:\nExploit Jackpot Webshell\nPenetration through exploiting ProxyShell (Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerability)\nExploit HUI Loader\nNext, they explained about HUI Loader. It loads SoadMaster by using an attack technique called DLL side-loading on legitimate files. HUI Loader and SoadMaster stores the DLL files they load in a different folder.\nRegarding the connection between the A41APT campaign and attack groups, they discussed the possibility of multiple attack groups involved, based on the fact that security researchers overseas identified HUI Loader in LockFile ransomware and BRONZE RIVERSIDE (a.k.a. APT10) incidents. \nFinally, he said that it is important to understand the status of security measures in ones own and related organizations because since 2020, incidents are more likely to occur in places with weak security measures."
