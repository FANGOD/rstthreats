                        "He first presented Campaign 1. The attack starts with a phishing email with the malware LAMICE attached. LAMICE drops BUSYICE and other type of malware, which then downloads new backdoors. He found that the way LAMICE generates a file name for the malware it drops is identical to that of Earth Hunduns TTP. In addition, he found connections and overlaps between the attack infrastructure of malware used by Earth Hundun, such as Gh0stTimes, and that of BUSYICE. For these reasons, he associated Campaign 1 with Earth Hundun.<crlf>He next presented Campaign 2. This campaign drops SELFMAKE through ProxyLogon, a vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server or via malware bundled installer. It eventually executes SPIDERPIG on memory. He found that the format of the Mutex strings created by SPIDERPIG and BUSYICE are similar, and he also observed a case where SPIDERPIG was dropped from LAMICE in November 2021. For these reasons, he concluded that the attack groups of Campaign 1 and 2 are probably the same and therefore that Campaign 2 is Earth Hundun.<crlf>Finally, he explained that in the future, it will be important to continuously disclose the process of attribution and redefine attack groups in order to keep up with attacker groups, which keep changing by sharing attack tools with other groups."

When communicating with the C2 server, the malware accesses a domain or URL that does not exist, and a part of the response data (NXDOMAIN) is used for a label that identifies WinDealer-infected devices. The label is used for a custom header when sending data to the C2 server. In addition, WinDealer uses IPGA (IP Generation Algorithm) to generate a random IP address from a specified range for C2 server to avoid tracking.<crlf>They also introduced an incident case of LuoYu. In this case, a legitimate application such as TIM (a communication tool) downloaded WinDealer, and then the device got infected with it. Finally, they described the results of threat analysis of the campaign using frameworks such as Diamond Model and MITRE ATT&CK."

LAMICE drops BUSYICE and other type of malware, which then downloads new backdoors. He found that the way LAMICE generates a file name for the malware it drops is identical to that of Earth Hunduns TTP. In addition, he found connections and overlaps between the attack infrastructure of malware used by Earth Hundun, such as Gh0stTimes, and that of BUSYICE. For these reasons, he associated Campaign 1 with Earth Hundun.<crlf>He next presented Campaign 2. This campaign drops SELFMAKE through ProxyLogon, a vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server or via malware bundled installer. It eventually executes SPIDERPIG on memory. He found that the format of the Mutex strings created by SPIDERPIG and BUSYICE are similar, and he also observed a case where SPIDERPIG was dropped from LAMICE in November 2021. For these reasons, he concluded that the attack groups of Campaign 1 and 2 are probably the same and therefore that Campaign 2 is Earth Hundun.<crlf>Finally, he explained that in the future, it will be important to continuously disclose the process of attribution and redefine attack groups in order to keep up with attacker groups, which keep changing by sharing attack tools with other groups."

In addition, he found connections and overlaps between the attack infrastructure of malware used by Earth Hundun, such as Gh0stTimes, and that of BUSYICE. For these reasons, he associated Campaign 1 with Earth Hundun.<crlf>He next presented Campaign 2. This campaign drops SELFMAKE through ProxyLogon, a vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server or via malware bundled installer. It eventually executes SPIDERPIG on memory. He found that the format of the Mutex strings created by SPIDERPIG and BUSYICE are similar, and he also observed a case where SPIDERPIG was dropped from LAMICE in November 2021. For these reasons, he concluded that the attack groups of Campaign 1 and 2 are probably the same and therefore that Campaign 2 is Earth Hundun.<crlf>Finally, he explained that in the future, it will be important to continuously disclose the process of attribution and redefine attack groups in order to keep up with attacker groups, which keep changing by sharing attack tools with other groups."

He found that the way LAMICE generates a file name for the malware it drops is identical to that of Earth Hunduns TTP. In addition, he found connections and overlaps between the attack infrastructure of malware used by Earth Hundun, such as Gh0stTimes, and that of BUSYICE. For these reasons, he associated Campaign 1 with Earth Hundun.<crlf>He next presented Campaign 2. This campaign drops SELFMAKE through ProxyLogon, a vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server or via malware bundled installer. It eventually executes SPIDERPIG on memory. He found that the format of the Mutex strings created by SPIDERPIG and BUSYICE are similar, and he also observed a case where SPIDERPIG was dropped from LAMICE in November 2021. For these reasons, he concluded that the attack groups of Campaign 1 and 2 are probably the same and therefore that Campaign 2 is Earth Hundun.<crlf>Finally, he explained that in the future, it will be important to continuously disclose the process of attribution and redefine attack groups in order to keep up with attacker groups, which keep changing by sharing attack tools with other groups."

The purpose of this conference is to raise the knowledge and technical level of security analysts in Japan, and we aimed to bring them together in one place where they can share technical knowledge related to incident analysis and response. This year was the fifth time the conference was held. 9 presentations and 2 workshops, selected from 18 CFP and CFW submissions, were presented.",

The speakers remarked that the exploitation of new vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2021-40444) and the distribution of Magniber through social engineering were the features of 2021.<crlf>Next, a case study of the Magniber infection using Magnitude Exploit Kit and social engineering was described. When the kit was executed, a window asking for update appeared on Microsoft Edge. The malware was transmitted by downloading and installing AppX file (Windows Application Package) with a valid digital signature. The speakers also noted that Magniber has been updated to remove unnecessary features.<crlf>In the end, a few methods for investigating and detecting the Magnitude Exploit Kit and Magniber were presented based on their distinctive features.",
                        "According to the presentation, there was about a week between the release of the PoC for the vulnerability and the launch of the attack. Another aspect of the attack was that Movable Type was used more concentratedly in Japan than in other regions, which resulted in the delay in the actions by foreign security vendors. Japanese local vendors therefore proactively collected and verified information as well as alerted users and provide measures. <crlf>Next, the analysis of the following tools used in the vulnerability exploit was presented.",

Next, he shared and explained the trend of abused Japanese RESIPs, mainly from the following perspectives:",

When the kit was executed, a window asking for update appeared on Microsoft Edge. The malware was transmitted by downloading and installing AppX file (Windows Application Package) with a valid digital signature. The speakers also noted that Magniber has been updated to remove unnecessary features.<crlf>In the end, a few methods for investigating and detecting the Magnitude Exploit Kit and Magniber were presented based on their distinctive features."

LAMICE drops BUSYICE and other type of malware, which then downloads new backdoors. He found that the way LAMICE generates a file name for the malware it drops is identical to that of Earth Hunduns TTP. In addition, he found connections and overlaps between the attack infrastructure of malware used by Earth Hundun, such as Gh0stTimes, and that of BUSYICE. For these reasons, he associated Campaign 1 with Earth Hundun.<crlf>He next presented Campaign 2. This campaign drops SELFMAKE through ProxyLogon, a vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server or via malware bundled installer. It eventually executes SPIDERPIG on memory. He found that the format of the Mutex strings created by SPIDERPIG and BUSYICE are similar, and he also observed a case where SPIDERPIG was dropped from LAMICE in November 2021. For these reasons, he concluded that the attack groups of Campaign 1 and 2 are probably the same and therefore that Campaign 2 is Earth Hundun.<crlf>Finally, he explained that in the future, it will be important to continuously disclose the process of attribution and redefine attack groups in order to keep up with attacker groups, which keep changing by sharing attack tools with other groups."
