                        "In August 2021, Quantum Ransomware was identified for the first time. One of the first access vectors used by the threat actors is the IcedID virus, which uses Cobalt Strike for remote access and leads to data theft and encryption using Quantum Locker. Using phishing emails with an ISO file attached, IcedID gained initial access to the targets PC. To get beyond email security restrictions, IcedID and ISO archive are a fantastic combination. Cobalt Strike was injected two hours after the infection had begun. Threat actors eventually employed WMI and PsExec to encrypt machines and deploy the Quantum ransomware payload. The attack was completed in less than four hours, which is extremely impressive."

One of the first access vectors used by the threat actors is the IcedID virus, which uses Cobalt Strike for remote access and leads to data theft and encryption using Quantum Locker. Using phishing emails with an ISO file attached, IcedID gained initial access to the targets PC. To get beyond email security restrictions, IcedID and ISO archive are a fantastic combination. Cobalt Strike was injected two hours after the infection had begun. Threat actors eventually employed WMI and PsExec to encrypt machines and deploy the Quantum ransomware payload. The attack was completed in less than four hours, which is extremely impressive."
