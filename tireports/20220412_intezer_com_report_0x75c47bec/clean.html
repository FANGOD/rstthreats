<h2>Integrate with SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, and More</h2>
<p>One of the biggest pain points of cyber security teams is alert fatigue – trying to keep up with a tedious, never-ending stream of alerts to triage. In today’s reality, security teams spend a large amount of their valuable time on confirming alerts instead of investigating real incidents.</p>
<p>To tackle the alert fatigue most security teams experience and help improve MTTR (mean time to respond), we have developed Intezer EDR Connect. Intezer EDR Connect provides you with a lightweight and simple way to automate EDR alert triage. We use <a class="blog-text-link" href="https://www.intezer.com/intezer-analyze/">Intezer</a> to enrich file-based alerts in your EDR and accelerate the investigation and prioritization processes.</p>
<p>In this post we will briefly overview the “journey” of an alert and explain how Intezer EDR Connect accelerates this journey. </p>

<h2 id="h-the-journey-of-an-alert">The Journey of an Alert</h2>
<p>From confirmation through prioritization and response.</p>
<h3 id="h-confirmation">Confirmation</h3>
<p>In this step we will confirm that the alert is indeed a true-positive. </p>
<p>EDRs and other detection engines are designed to provide signals about suspicious behavior or anomalies in the context of the entity they are monitoring (endpoints, emails, etc.). These signals raise a high volume of alerts, and depending on your tuning and tooling, can contain a large percentage of low priority alerts or false positives. </p>
<p>As an example, the behavior of creating <a class="blog-text-link" href="https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">persistence</a> can be seen in both malicious and legitimate software. </p>
<p>Recent study by <a class="blog-text-link" href="https://orangecyberdefense.com/global/security-navigator/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Orange cyber defense</a> shows that malware detection signals have doubled from 2020 to 2021. With organizations expanding their EDR deployments, the number of detection signals increases as well.</p>
<p>Overcoming false positives by turning off noisy signals or excluding directories that trigger noisy alerts is bad practice. Remember the SolarWinds cyberattack? SolarWinds advised <a class="blog-text-link" href="https://twitter.com/ffforward/status/1338785034375999491?s=20&amp;t=gVTOf4VzDo-n1wPJnIewpA" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">excluding directories</a> from anti-malware scanning to avoid false positives. Same directories that contained the malicious DLLs that were part of the attack. </p>
<h3 id="h-prioritization">Prioritization</h3>
<p>For confirmed file-based incidents, knowing that the file is malicious is not enough. Malware attribution and classification is crucial for properly responding and prioritizing incident response.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s say we have an alert of a backdoor and an alert of a coin miner. We will first respond to the backdoor alert, because it has a higher potential for damaging the organization. It can potentially deliver ransomware or steal classified information of customers or of the organization, whereas the CoinMiner can damage performance, which also has destructive potential, but probably less than a backdoor. </p>
<h3 id="h-incident-response">Incident Response</h3>
<p>Creating detection and hunting rules are an essential part of cybersecurity teams’ responsibilities. One of the first steps after confirming an incident and initiating the incident response process, is hunting for the existence of the threat in other endpoints inside the organization. Hunting for file hashes or basic network artifacts is not enough. They are short lived and can be easily manipulated. This applies also for creating detection rules and providing IoCs to summarize the incident, all of which are part of the incident response lifecycle. </p>
<p>Enriching alerts with detection opportunities helps security teams create quality and effective rules to better accomplish tasks within the <a class="blog-text-link" href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-61r2.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">incident response lifecycle</a>. </p>
<h2 id="h-use-intezer-edr-connect-to-accelerate-your-alert-journey">Use Intezer EDR Connect to Accelerate your Alert Journey</h2>
<p>Intezer EDR connect integrates between your EDR and Intezer platform. </p>
<h3 id="h-how-does-it-work">How Does it Work?</h3>
<p>As shown in the diagram above, the connector fetches new file-based alerts from your EDR and sends them to analysis in Intezer. Then, the connector pushes the analysis result to the EDR as an incident note. </p>
<p>Intezer analyzes files using both static and dynamic techniques. It detonates the file in a sandbox, extracts memory modules, and compares the extracted code against an extensive code genome database. Intezer’s unique code reuse detection technology allows you to determine the file verdict and its <a class="blog-text-link" href="https://analyze.intezer.com/files/7e840af1a1cac73a67f9b3e22563161feb6d16a529189e776f6661ba84d4c34c" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">classification and origin</a>. This capability enables you to confirm and prioritize alerts within seconds. </p>

<p>To help you with the incident response process, investigation and quality rules creation within the entire incident response lifecycle, we have added the Detect &amp; Hunt feature. Detect &amp; Hunt combines our unique classification abilities with sandboxing, to present high-quality detection content. By matching the malware behavior against a huge database of malware and benign software behavior, we filter out non-relevant artifacts and present those that are unique to the studied sample or that have been previously seen in other malware samples. This allows analysts to quickly create effective rules, with high accuracy and low false-positive rate.</p>
