Ensure logging is in place to record MFA device enrolment Security controls such as Conditional Access can help restrict or prevent unauthorised access based on criteria such as geographical location. Implement activities to detect and investigate anomalies in VPN access. Ensure a system is in place to record all helpdesk queries. Avoid using SMS as an MFA vector to avoid the risk of SIM swapping. Securing source code environments to ensure that users can only access the relevant repositories. Secret Scanning[1][2] on source code repositories should be conducted to ensure that sensitive API credentials are not stored in source code. GitHub and Gitlab offer detection mechanisms for this Remote Desktop services or Gateways used as a primary or secondary remote access solution should be removed from any corporate environment in favour for alternative solutions such as secured VPNs, or other Remote Desktop applications which mitigate common attack techniques such as brute force or exploitation and can offer additional security controls such as MFA and Conditional Access. Centralise logging including cloud applications (SIEM solution). Offline or immutable backups of servers should be taken to ensure that in the event of a data disruption or destruction attack, services can be restored. Reduce MFA token/Session cookie validity times Ensure principle of least privilege for user accounts is being adhered to. Social engineering awareness training for all staff."}
