                        "This post describes the techniques, tactics and procedures we observed during recent LAPSUS$ incidents.",
                        "LAPSUS$ first appeared publicly in December 2021, however, NCC Group first observed LAPSUS$ months prior during an incident response engagement. We believe the group has also operated prior to this date, though perhaps not under the LAPSUS$ banner.",
                        "In one incident LAPSUS$ were observed to sporadically move through the victim environment via RDP in an attempt to access resources deeper in the victim environment. In some instances, victim controlled hostnames were revealed including the host VULTR-GUEST which refers to infrastructure hosted on the private cloud service, Vultr[3].",
                        "Over the last 5 months, LAPSUS$ has gained large notoriety with some successful breaches of some large enterprises including, Microsoft, Nvidia, Okta & Samsung. Little is still known about this group with motivations appearing to be for reputation, money and for the lulz.",
                        "It is notable that the majority of LAPSUS$ actions exploit the human element as opposed to technical deficiencies or vulnerabilities. Although potentially viewed as unsophisticated or basic these techniques have been successful, so it is vital that organisations factor in controls and mitigations to address them.",
                        "In the investigations conducted by NCC Group, little to no malware is used. In one case NCC Group observed LAPSUS$ using nothing more than the legitimate Sysinternals tool ADExplorer, which was used to conduct reconnaissance on the victims environment.",
                        "NCC Group has observed disruption and destruction to client environments by LAPSUS$ such as shutting down virtual machines from within on-premises VMware ESXi infrastructure, to the extreme of mass deletion of virtual machines, storage, and configurations in cloud environments making it harder for the victim to recover and for the investigation team to conduct their analysis activities.",
                        "Threat Intelligence shows that LAPSUS$ utilise multiple methods to gain Initial access.",
                        "Notifications or responsibility of victims by LAPSUS$ are commonly reported via their telegram channel and in one case a victims DNS records were reconfigured to LAPSUS$ controlled domains/websites. However, not all victims or breaches appear to actively be announced via their telegram channel, nor are some victims approached with a ransom. This distinguishes themselves from more traditional ransomware groups who have a clear modus operandi and are clearly financially focused. The result of this is that LAPSUS$ are less predictable which may be why they have seen recent success.",
                        "LAPSUS$s action on objectives appears to focus on data exfiltration of sensitive information as well as destruction or disruption. In one particular incident the threat actor is observed to utilise the free file drop service filetransfer[.]io.",
                        "Credential Harvesting and privileged escalation are key components of the LAPSUS$ breaches we have seen, with rapid escalation in privileges the LAPSUS$ group have been seen to elevate from a standard user account to an administrative user within a couple of days."
