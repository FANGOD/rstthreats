Switch to uncommon but reputable and<crlf>secure email clients.<crlf>Ensure that all your devices and logins are stored in your password manager and use the password generator<crlf>Ensure all your logins are connected to your authenticator app/device.<crlf>Your anti-virus software should be enabled to lock and erase your device if its stolen.<crlf>Use Securedrop for document sharing, etc.<crlf>Use a different SMS app (Disable iMessage, or if possible, delete it since it has been abused by Pegasus & other threat<crlf>actors multiple times exploiting zero-day providing the Pegasus an initial access point. It will be not wrong to say its<crlf>their favorite attack spot).<crlf>Only open links from known and trusted contacts and sources when using your device.<crlf>Make sure your device is updated with any relevant patches and upgrades.<crlf>Avoid public and free Wi-Fi services (including hotels), especially when accessing sensitive information.<crlf>Do not blindly approve app permission requests.<crlf>Keep checking app permissions.",
