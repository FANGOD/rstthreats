The tools can be used to scan for affected devices, compromise them, and also control them. Known vulnerabilities are also being exploited by the threat actors. The following devices are being exploited by APT actors:\nSchneider Electric MODICON and MODICON Nano PLCs, including (but may not be limited to) TM251, TM241, M258, M238, LMC058, and LMC078;\nOMRON Sysmac NJ and NX PLCs, including (but may not be limited to) NEX NX1P2, NXSL3300, NX-ECC203, NJ501-1300, S8VK, and R88D-1SN10F-ECT; and\nOPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) servers.\nA known vulnerability CVE-2020-15368 in which an ASRocksigned motherboard driver, AsrDrv103.sys is being exploited to run malicious codes on windows servers. Lateral movement and disruption of critical devices are only part of the attack capabilities of these APT tools. The tools can also:\nIdentify all Schneider PLCs by running a rapid scan.\nPasswords for e Schneider Electric PLCs can also be identified using brute-force attacks.\nConduct a denial-of-service attack.\nCrash PLCs using a packet of death attack.\nRetrieve MAC addresses.\nBackup and restore files from the PLC."

Use unique and strong passwords to mitigate dictionary and brute-force attacks.\nBackup your data. Any damage in case of a successful attack will be mitigated if data is backed up.\nLimit access to administrative accounts and portals to only relevant personnel and make sure they are not publicly accessible.\nSet up a Web Application Firewall with rules to block suspicious and malicious requests.\nLog your IT/OT environments network activity and web server activity.\nMonitor systems for loading of unusual drivers, especially for ASRock drivers."
