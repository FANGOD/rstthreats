                        "Netskope Private Access (NPA) is Netskopes answer to the recommendation of adopting a zero trust security model. NPA allows you to publish resources in a simple and secure manner providing a zero trust alternative to legacy remote access technologies and preventing the direct exposure of services like SMB, RDP, or SSH, whether they are located in a local data center, or in a private or public cloud. NPA can also perform a check on the security posture of the endpoint before accessing the target application, overcoming the limitations of legacy remote access technologies. NPA mitigates several risks in the top 10, including the lack of controls in traditional VPNs, cloud services left unprotected, or open ports and misconfigured services exposed to the internet."
