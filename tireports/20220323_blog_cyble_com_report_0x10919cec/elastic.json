This is done to bypass character limitations while sending SMSs.\nFigure 7 Code to Send SMS\nThe below code snippet represents the malwares ability to steal SMSs present in the victims device.\nFigure 8 Code to Steal Text SMSs\nThe malware uses the method callForward() which forwards the victims incoming calls to a number provided by TAs C&C server, as shown in the below figure.\nFigure 9 Code to Forwarding Calls\nThe method linkopen() provides the feature to the malware to open URLs in the device browser without the users intervention, as shown in Figure 10.\nFigure 10 Code to Open URL in Browser\nFigure 11 demonstrates the code that illustrates the malwares ability to steal application key logs.\nFigure 11 Code to Steal Application Keylogs\nThe malware also uses VNC Viewer to remotely view/control the screens of an infected device, as shown below.\nFigure 12 Uses VNC Viewer to Control Device Screen\nThe malware fetches the C&C URL from the Telegram channel hxxps://t[.]me/dobrynyanikitichsobre, which will send the sensitive data from the victims device as shown in Figure 13.
