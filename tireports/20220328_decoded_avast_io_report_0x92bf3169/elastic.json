            "text": "In our analysis we found the sample connects to dost[.]igov-service[.]net:8443 using TLS in a statically linked OpenSSL library.\nA WHOIS lookup on the C&C domain gave us the following:\nThe digital certificate was pinned so that the malware requires the certificate to communicate.\nWhen we checked the digital certificate used for the TLS channel we found the following information:\nSome important things to note:\nThe certificate is a valid certificate with a subject of *.navy.mil.ph, the Philippine Navy.\nThe certificate has recently expired: it was valid for one year, from Sunday December 15, 2019 until Tuesday December 15, 2020.\nOur research shows that Censys saw this certificate employed by the actual navy.mil.ph website\nBased on our research, we believe with a high level of confidence that the threat actor had access to the private key belonging to the certificate.\nWhile the digital certificate is now expired we see evidence it was in use with this malware in June 2020.\nThe malicious PE file was found with filename: C:\\Windows\\System32\\wlbsctrl.dll and its hash is: 85FA43C3F84B31FBE34BF078AF5A614612D32282D7B14523610A13944AADAACB.\nIn analyzing that malicious PE file itself, we found that the compilation timestamp is wrong or was edited. Specifically, the TimeDateStamp of the PE file was modified and set to the year 2004 in both the PE header and Debug Directory as shown below:\nHowever, we found that the author used OpenSSL 1.1.1g and compiled it on April 21, 2020 as shown below:\nThe username of the author was probably udste. This can be seen in the debug information left inside the used OpenSSL library.\nWe found that the malware supported the following commands:\nrun shellcode\nread file\nwrite file\ncancel data transfer\nlist drives\nrename a file\ndelete a file\nlist directory content\nSome additional items of note regarding the malicious PE file:\nAll configuration strings in the malware are encrypted using AES-CBC with the exception of the mutex it uses.That mutex is used as-is without decryption: t7As7y9I6EGwJOQkJz1oRvPUFx1CJTsjzgDlm0CxIa4=.\nWhen this string is decrypted using the hard-coded key it decrypts to QSR_MUTEX_zGKwWAejTD9sDitYcK. We suspect that this is a failed attempt to disguise this malware as the infamous Quasar RAT malware. But this cannot be the case because this sample is written in C++ and the Quasar RAT is written in C#.\nAvast customers are protected against this malware."
