This wiper was detected as early as March 17, 2022. DoubleZero is yet another wiper discovered in addition to previously disclosed attacks we've seen in Ukraine over the past two months, such as \"\nCaddyWiper\n\" \"\nHermeticWiper\n\" and \"\nWhisperGate\n.\"\nDoubleZero is a .NET-based implant that destroys files, registry keys and trees on the infected endpoint.\nCisco Talos is actively conducting analysis to confirm the details included in these reports."

If the endpoint's name is found, the wiper simply stops executing.\nThe wiper begins by obtaining the following privileges on the endpoint:\nSeTakeOwnershipPrivilege\nSeRestorePrivilege\nSeBackupPrivilege\nSeShutdownPrivilege\nIt aims to overwrite all files in all drives by destroying all files in all drives except for a specific list of the locations hardcoded in the wiper. The malware intends to destroy non-system files first, then system-related files. Destroying system related files while the overwriting of other files is pending can create instability and may lead to bricking the system before the complete destruction of the user's files is completed. In such cases, it may be possible to recover the files from the disk that haven't been overwritten yet.\nThe system folders reserved for destruction *after* all other files have been destroyed:\n<Root_drive>\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\n<Root_drive>\\Windows\n<Root_drive>\\\\Users\\\\\\\\.*?\\\\\\\\Local Settings.*\n<Root_drive>\\\\Users\\\\\\\\.*?\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Local\\\\\\\\Application Data.*\n<Root_drive>\\\\Users\\\\\\\\.*?\\\\\\\\Start Menu.*\n<Root_drive>\\\\Users\\\\\\\\.*?\\\\\\\\Application Data.*\n<Root_drive>\\\\ProgramData\\\\\\\\Microsoft.*\n<Root_drive>\\\\Users\\\\\\\\.*?\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Local\\\\\\\\Microsoft.*\n<Root_drive>\\\\Users\\\\\\\\.*?\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Roaming\\\\\\\\Microsoft.*\n<Root_drive>\\Documents and Settings\n<Root_drive>\\ProgramData\\Application Data\n<Root_drive>\\Users\\All Users\n<Root_drive>\\Users\\Default User\n<Root_drive>\\system\\drivers\n<Root_drive>\\Windows\\NTDS\nThe wiper will enumerate all file paths and decide if the file is \"safe\" to destroy immediately i.e., not a system file.\nFor each file that is deemed \"safe\" to destroy (i.e., not in the exclusions listed above), the wiper will:\nChange the access control of files by giving the Local System Account (WellKnownSidType.LocalSystemSid) full control of the file.\nUse one of the two wiper functions to destroy the files."
