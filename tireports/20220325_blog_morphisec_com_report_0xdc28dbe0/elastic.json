The victim receives a malicious attachment, either an XLM or XLL file, inside an email. Once the attachment is downloaded and executed, Excel loads and executes the malicious code inside the .xll file, which then downloads the payload from a remote server. The payload is a new, similar variant of JSSLoader."

Because the file isnt signed, a popup displays for the user before executing:\nFigure 2: Microsoft security popup\nEach XLL file must implement and export the xlAutoOpen function. This function is called by Excel whenever an XLL is activated. In our case, the malicious activity is located at the end of xlAutoOpen:\nFigure 3: Malicious code inside xlAutoOpen\nBefore exiting from the function, the malware loads itself, the .XLL file, into memory (not relevant to the attack) and calls the mw_download_and_execute function.\nThis function is responsible for downloading the payload from a remote server. An attacker uses a different User-Agent between samples to help avoid network signature-based security solutions.\nFigure 4: User Agent changes between samples\nOnce downloaded, the XLL file creates a temp file with a DNA prefix using a GetTempFileNameW API call and executes it as a new process.\nFigure 5: Temporary file creation"

It does so by splitting the strings into substrings and concatenating them at runtime.\nFigure 8: Strings obfuscation comparison"
