                        "SystemBC malware is recently being distributed through Emotet and SmokeLoader. The malware has been used in multiple ransomware attacks over the past few years. SystemBC acts as a Proxy Bot and if an infected system has SystemBC on it, then the system can be used as a passage to access the victims address. The earlier versions of the malware were distributed using Fallout exploit kit and RIG exploit kit. The 2020 version was used with Egregor or Ryuk-associated ransomware attacks. DarkSide ransomware group also used the malware. SystemBC is mainly used as a proxy and to download and install additional payloads. It might be installed in internal networks to perform the role of a proxy or download and execute malicious payloads."
