                        "The oRAT malware targets macOS users using a combination of custom-written code and public Golang repos. The developers are clearly familiar with using sophisticated features of Go for networking and communications, but due to the simplistic way the malware dropper was packaged, unsigned and with no observable install to distract the victim, it would seem they are less experienced with the challenges of infecting Mac users. Unfortunately, other threat actors have provided plenty of examples from which this new player can learn, and security teams should expect to see any future campaigns from this actor using more sophisticated droppers.",

The encrypted data at the end of the unpacked binary occupies 166 bytes and consists of the data, an AES key, and two bytes representing the entire blob size.",
                        "The packed binary is around 3MB in size, but after unpacking we are presented with a massive ~10MB file. Such large file sizes are typical of cross-platform malware, particularly when binaries are compiled in Go, since they contain the entire run-time for the language along with a number of supporting libraries.",
                        "After the malware decodes the config, it calls into sym._orat_cmd_agent.app and begins a number of loops through sys._orat_protocal.Dial. Depending on the config, it will call one of orat_protocol.DialTCP, orat_protocol.DialSTCP or orat_protocol.DialSUDP to establish a connection. The TCP protocols leverage smux while the SUDP protocol leverages QUIC. The malware loops with a sleep cycle of 5 seconds as it waits for a response.",

Unfortunately, other threat actors have provided plenty of examples from which this new player can learn, and security teams should expect to see any future campaigns from this actor using more sophisticated droppers.",
