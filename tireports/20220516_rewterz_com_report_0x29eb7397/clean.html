<h2>Severity</h2>
<p>Medium</p>
<h2>Analysis Summary</h2>
<h4>CVE-2022-29028 CVSS:3.3</h4>
<p>Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an infinite loop condition in the Tiff_Loader.dll dynamic link library when parsing TIFF files. By persuading a victim to open a specially-crafted TIFF file, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.</p>
<h4>CVE-2022-29029 CVSS:3.3</h4>
<p>Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference in the CGM_NIST_Loader.dll dynamic link library when parsing CGM files. By persuading a victim to open a specially-crafted CGM file, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.</p>
<h4>CVE-2022-29030 CVSS:3.3</h4>
<p>Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an integer overflow in the Mono_Loader.dll dynamic link library when parsing TG4 files. By persuading a victim to open a specially-crafted TG4 file, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.</p>
<h4>CVE-2022-29031 CVSS:3.3</h4>
<p>Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference in the CGM_NIST_Loader.dll dynamic link library when parsing CGM files. By persuading a victim to open a specially-crafted CGM file, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.</p>
<h4>CVE-2022-29032 CVsS:7.8</h4>
<p>Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a double free in the CGM_NIST_Loader.dll dynamic link library when parsing CGM files. By persuading a victim to open a specially-crafted CGM file, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system.</p>
<h4>CVE-2022-29033 CVsS:7.8</h4>
<p>Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an uninitialized pointer free in CGM_NIST_Loader.dll dynamic link library when parsing CGM files. By persuading a victim to open a specially-crafted CGM file, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system.</p>
