On the right, a smartphone is infected with Bian Lian. Our fake C2 shows communication with the infected smartphone. The end-user activates Accessibility Services.",
                        "Note the infected Video Player disappears from the list of applications: the end-user cant see it any longer. Then, the end-user launches an application. See how the malware injects a fake login page. This login page actually sits on top of the existing banks app. The Bian Lian malware, running in the background, takes regular screenshots of the victims smartphone. This is a way the malware can steal banking credentials.",
                        "We have been closely investigating the Android BianLian botnet (also known as Hydra). This botnet emerged in 2018. It is still very alive in 2022, particularly active since the beginning of 2022, where we are closely monitoring at least three independent campaigns.",
