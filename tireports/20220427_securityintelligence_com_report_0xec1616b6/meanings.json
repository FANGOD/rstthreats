                        "Through continued research into the ongoing cyber activity throughout Eastern Europe, IBM Security X-Force identified a phishing email campaign by Hive0117, likely a financially motivated cybercriminal group, from February 2022, designed to deliver the fileless malware variant dubbed DarkWatchman. The campaign masquerades as official communications from the Russian Governments Federal Bailiffs Service, the Russian-language emails are addressed to users in Lithuania, Estonia, and Russia in the Telecommunications, Electronic and Industrial sectors. The activity predates and is not believed to be associated with the Russian-led invasion of Ukraine.",
                        "The phishing activity discovered by X-Force (tracked internally as Hive0117) aligns with research published in December 2021, detailing a similar phishing campaign designed to deliver a DarkWatchman payload by imitating a Russia-based freight and logistics company.",
                        "The majority of the new malware samples discovered by X-Force, appear to be based on a C2 IP address (103.153.157[.]33) previously associated with Hive0117 activity. One of the samples was submitted to Virus Total in February 2022 and is configured to use several C2 domains including d303790c[.]top, which overlaps with previously uncovered malicious executable 12-6317-3621.exe.",
                        "The emails are crafted to appear to originate from the official address of the Federal Bailiffs Service in Russia, a federal law enforcement agency under the Russian Ministry of Justice; however, header examination revealed that some of the emails were received from shtampuy[.]ru (free.ds [185.64.76.158]). The majority of emails feature the return path address mail@r77[.]fssprus[.]ru, meant to imitate the organizations authentic address https://r77.fssp.gov[.]ru. However, for unknown reasons, a single instance imitates a sender which seeks to pose as the head of a purported Russian investment company. The subjects of Hive0117 emails, including official notices, are eye-catching and are likely intended to compel the target to open the email and access the attachment.",
                        "Given the fileless nature of the malware, coupled with a JavaScript and a keylogger written in C#, and the abilities to remove traces of its existence on the compromised system when instructed, X-Force assesses that malicious actor(s) behind Hive0117 activity are of moderate sophistication.",
                        "X-Force assesses Hive0117 phishing campaigns are likely criminally motivated in nature given the target selection and focuses of current and previous activities. Additionally, while the target list of the phishing campaign attributed to Hive0117 has regional associations with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the activity predates the invasion, indicating the separate from any politically charged associations that have spurred recent waves of criminal activity, such as the attack on a German subsidiary of a Russian state-affiliated energy company.",

The campaign masquerades as official communications from the Russian Governments Federal Bailiffs Service, the Russian-language emails are addressed to users in Lithuania, Estonia, and Russia in the Telecommunications, Electronic and Industrial sectors. The activity predates and is not believed to be associated with the Russian-led invasion of Ukraine.",

                        "X-Force discovered multiple emails that were sent in mid-February 2022 to individual users, including a state-owned communication company based in Lithuania, a prominent Industrial Enterprise in Estonia, and several electronic and telecommunication businesses located in Russia. In some cases, the emails were targeting company owners, as well as individuals in leadership positions associated with Dispatch Services and Sales. Targeted organizations could be of high value to criminal actors given the targets potential trusted access to wide, and distributed client base."
