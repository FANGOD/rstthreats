                        "Multi-year Cyber Espionage Intrusions: The Cybereason IR team investigated a sophisticated and elusive cyber espionage operation that has remained undetected since at least 2019 with the goal of stealing sensitive proprietary information from technology and manufacturing companies, mainly in East Asia, Western Europe, and North America.<crlf>Newly Discovered Malware and Multi-Stage Infection Chain: Part two of the research examines both known and previously undocumented Winnti malware which included digitally signed kernel-level rootkits as well as an elaborate multi-stage infection chain which enabled the operation to remain undetected since at least 2019.",
                        "Cybereason assesses with moderate-high confidence that the threat actor behind the intrusion is the Winnti Group (also tracked as APT41, Blackfly and BARIUM), one of the most advanced and elusive APT groups that is known to operate on behalf of Chinese state interests and whose members have been indicted by the US Department of Justice for severe computer crimes.",
                        "According to the Cybereason IR investigation, the infection vector that was used to compromise Winnti targets consisted of the exploitation of a popular ERP solution leveraging multiple vulnerabilities, some known and some that were unknown at the time of the exploitation.",
                        "Part 1 of this research offers a unique glimpse into the Winnti intrusion playbook, covering the techniques that were used by the group from initial compromise to data exfiltration, as observed and analyzed by the Cybereason IR Team. Part two of this research will offer a deep dive analysis of the groups tools and unique malware, including undocumented newly discovered Winnti malware.",
                        "The Winnti Playbook: This research offers a unique glimpse into the Winnti intrusion playbook, detailing the most frequently used tactics, as well as some lesser known evasive techniques that were observed during the investigation.",
                        "After establishing a foothold on multiple machines in the network, Winnti began leveraging Scheduled Tasks to execute batch scripts by the names cc.bat or bc.bat. The content of these batch files varied from one machine to another, each time containing different reconnaissance commands based on the attackers goals. Examples of this type of reconnaissance commands are as follows:",
                        "The attackers abused the legitimate IKEEXT and PrintNotify Windows Services to side-load Winnti DLLs and preserve persistence. Full analysis will also be provided in part two of the research.",
                        "In the first part of this Winnti research, we reported the discovery of multiple sets of intrusions that went undetected for years. These intrusions targeted technology and manufacturing companies in multiple regions of the world to steal sensitive information for cyber espionage purposes.",
                        "Winnti Malware Modules Names",
                        "During 2021, Cybereason Nocturnus investigated an elaborate espionage operation targeting a number of prominent organizations in Asia, Europe and North America. Cybereason attributes with moderate-to-high confidence that this operation was carried out by the Winnti APT group (also known as APT41, BARIUM, and Blackfly) - a Chinese state-sponsored APT that has been active since at least 2010.",
                        "In this part of the research, we offered readers a unique glimpse into the attackers playbook, forensically tracing the attack steps from initial compromise all the way through data exfiltration. In part two of this research, we will take a deep dive into the Winnti malware arsenal, analyzing the different implants and unique infection chains.",
                        "The attackers leveraged a Signed Kernel Rootkit to establish an additional persistence mechanism. Detailed analysis of this stealthy rootkit will be provided in part two of this research in the series, which offers a deep dive into the Winnti malware arsenal.",
                        "After establishing a Webshell-based foothold, the attackers shifted their focus to internal reconnaissance and lateral movement efforts. This is not the first time Winnti has used Webshell as a foothold tactic; in March 2021, ESET published a report naming Winnti as one of the groups that targeted Exchange servers and deployed Webshell on the compromised systems.",
                        "This manner of execution resembles ACEHASH, a credential theft and password dumping utility, which was leveraged by the Winnti group in the past, using commands such as c64.exe f64.data \"9839D7F1A0 -m:",
                        "The Cybereason Nocturnus IR team observed multiple persistence techniques that were used by Winnti over the course of the intrusion. While some techniques are quite trivial and well-known, some persistence techniques are rare and advanced which only a handful of threat actors are known to have used before.",
                        "Winnti APT Group: Cybereason assesses with moderate-to-high confidence that the threat actor behind the set of intrusions is the Winnti Group, a Chinese state-sponsored APT group known for its stealth, sophistication and a focus on stealing technology.",
                        "One of the first actions that were taken after a successful exploit was an attempt to find a specific DLL file under the VMware Tools folder, gthread-3.6.dll. The DLL file is invoked by the intermediate dropper, and the role of the DLL is to inject the payload into svchost.exe on the targeted system. This TTP has been observed before, and is known to be characteristic of the Winnti group:",
                        "Based on our analysis and the information available, we assess with moderate-to-high confidence that the attacks described in this report were carried out by the notorious Winnti APT Group, a highly sophisticated APT group operating on behalf of Chinese state interests that has been active since at least 2010. The group has been known over the years for its focus on intellectual property theft."
