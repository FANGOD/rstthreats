The malware also modifies the clipboard content in an attempt to redirect cryptocurrency transactions by users of the infected computer. On each clipboard update, it scans the clipboard content for wallet addresses, recognizing address formats used by at least a dozen different cryptocurrencies. The recognized addresses are then replaced with addresses of wallets controlled by the attacker. For the majority of the address formats, the attackers provide multiple replacement wallet addresses to choose from. The malware then picks the address that matches the prefix of the address to be replaced. This way, the victim is less likely to notice manipulation and is likely to proceed with the transaction. The malware includes a total of 4,375 unique addresses of wallets controlled by the attacker. Out of these, 3,677 addresses are used for just three different formats of Bitcoin addresses. Investigating just Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet addresses, we found that they, at the time of writing, contained approximately 34.3 Bitcoin and 129.9 Ethereum. However, some funds had also been transferred to what appear to be cryptocurrency tumblers, also known as cryptocurrency mixing services. These services mix potentially identifiable funds with others, so as to obscure the trail back to the fund's original source. If we include the funds transferred out to these services, the malware operators have potentially made at least $1.7 million from clipboard hijacking alone."}
