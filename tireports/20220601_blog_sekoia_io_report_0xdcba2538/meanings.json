                        "At this time, we dont know why Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool allows arbitrary PowerShell execution inside the IT_BrowseForFile parameter. However, it is likely that researchers will find other vulnerable Microsoft utilities allowing such PowerShell execution in their parameters arguments in the coming weeks.<crlf>It is important to note that this vulnerability (CVE-2022-30190, also dubbed Follina by some security researchers) can be exploited even without opening the file by crafting a specific Rich Text Format (RTF) document and making the user preview it in the Windows Explorer Preview Pane. Several researchers pointed out that even if the docx exploitation chain seems to not work anymore, the RTF one is still vulnerable."

                        "On May 27th a malicious Microsoft Office document was discovered by the NAO SEC security team and other threat hunters as MalwareByte researchers on VirusTotal. This DOCX document (MD5:52945af1def85b171870b31fa4782e52) has been crafted to load a specific remote HTML file by using the MSHTML engine.<crlf>Once opened, the HTML file is using Javascript to replace its own URL by an URL containing the ms-msdt Protocol Scheme, pushing Microsoft Office to launch the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool utility (msdt.exe) with specific arguments, leading to the Remote Code Execution of an arbitrary Powershell payload. MSDT is a tool used to troubleshoot and collect diagnostic data for analysis by support professionals to resolve a problem.<crlf>Its not the first time that the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool is abused in order to obtain arbitrary code execution on Windows. In the past, it has been abused to execute specific remote executables via XSS vulnerabilities on Electron apps or as a Living of the Land (LOL) Windows binary.<crlf>However, the past exploitation required at least a one-click user interaction or a second XML file present on the computer to be achieved. In that specific case, no interaction is required by the user and MSDT directly executes the Powershell Script embedded in the IT_BrowseForFile parameter. As identified by John Hammond from the cybersecurity firm Huntress, the content of theIT_BrowseForFile parameter needs to fill these conditions to be executed:"

MSDT is a tool used to troubleshoot and collect diagnostic data for analysis by support professionals to resolve a problem.<crlf>Its not the first time that the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool is abused in order to obtain arbitrary code execution on Windows. In the past, it has been abused to execute specific remote executables via XSS vulnerabilities on Electron apps or as a Living of the Land (LOL) Windows binary.<crlf>However, the past exploitation required at least a one-click user interaction or a second XML file present on the computer to be achieved. In that specific case, no interaction is required by the user and MSDT directly executes the Powershell Script embedded in the IT_BrowseForFile parameter. As identified by John Hammond from the cybersecurity firm Huntress, the content of theIT_BrowseForFile parameter needs to fill these conditions to be executed:",
