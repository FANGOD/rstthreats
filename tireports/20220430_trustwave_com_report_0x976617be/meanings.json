                        "The group communicates through a Telegram channel and an .onion website on Tor. There is little chatter on the Telegram channel, with the conversation mainly comprised of the groups proclamations. While the group identifies itself as a ransomware group, it is not operating as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), and its not known what type of ransomware it may be using in their campaigns",
                        "The Stormous group has also signaled that it wont stand by and allow other entities, such as ransomware groups, to attack Russia. Stormous has declared it will respond to any attack against Russia, noting that if the attacks on Russia stop then, Stormous will halt its efforts.",
                        "As part of our regular Dark Web and cybercriminal research, Trustwave SpiderLabs has uncovered and analyzed postings from a politically motivated, pro-Russian ransomware group named Stormous. The group has recently proclaimed support for Russia in its war with Ukraine, attacking the Ukraine Ministry of Foreign Affairs and allegedly obtaining and making public phone numbers, email addresses, and national identity cards. But the group also claims to have a successful ransomware operation and has taken responsibility for cyber attacks on major American brands Coca-Cola, Mattel and Danaher. In total, Stormous claims to have already accessed and defaced 700 U.S. websites and attacked 44 American companies.",
                        "There is some debate within the cybersecurity community on the validity of Stormous claims, specifically in relation to the Coca-Cola hack. The community questions whether or not the group has truly breached the companies named and exfiltrated data or if its merely scavenging previously stolen or public information. For example, Mattel announced in November 2020, that it had been successfully hit by a ransomware attack earlier that year. The Stormous attackers could be simply compiling this already stolen data and packaging it as a new breach in an attempt to earn quick money."

In this case, perhaps because Stormous is relatively new to the scene, its postings and communications appear to be a brand-building exercise. Also, by pre-announcing the availability of supposedly stolen data, the group is trying to hype demand as any company might do with a new product. Finally, by taking a political stance, it likely hopes to attract supporters with similar viewpoints.",

                        "There is some debate within the cybersecurity community on the validity of Stormous claims, specifically in relation to the Coca-Cola hack. The community questions whether or not the group has truly breached the companies named and exfiltrated data or if its merely scavenging previously stolen or public information. For example, Mattel announced in November 2020, that it had been successfully hit by a ransomware attack earlier that year. The Stormous attackers could be simply compiling this already stolen data and packaging it as a new breach in an attempt to earn quick money.",
