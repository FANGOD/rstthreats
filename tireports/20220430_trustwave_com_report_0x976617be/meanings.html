                                <li>As part of our regular Dark Web and cybercriminal research, Trustwave SpiderLabs has uncovered and analyzed postings from a politically motivated, pro-Russian ransomware group named Stormous. The group has recently proclaimed support for Russia in its war with Ukraine, attacking the Ukraine Ministry of Foreign Affairs and allegedly obtaining and making public phone numbers, email addresses, and national identity cards. But the group also claims to have a successful ransomware operation and has taken responsibility for cyber attacks on major American brands Coca-Cola, Mattel and Danaher. In total, Stormous claims to have already accessed and defaced 700 U.S. websites and attacked 44 American companies.</li>
                            
                                <li>Our initial analysis of Stormous indicates the gang likely has members located in Mid-Eastern countries and Russia. Some of the group's postings are written in Arabic along with its public pro-Russian stance, which is consistent with the region. Moreover, two of the group's members that were arrested were from mid-eastern countries.</li>

However, the group did not define the type or amount of data it had taken, and neither Mattel nor Danaher reported suffering a related cyber incident.</li>
                            
                                <li>As of April 29, the group has listed the Coca-Cola data for sale on its Dark Web site. At the time of publishing, Coca-Cola has neither confirmed nor denied whether the data listed is legitimate. Most recently, the gang has promised to release additional stolen information from multinational toy manufacturer Mattel and medical diagnostics and healthcare technology company Danaher on May 1.</li>

                                <li>There is some debate within the cybersecurity community on the validity of Stormous claims, specifically in relation to the Coca-Cola hack. The community questions whether or not the group has truly breached the companies named and exfiltrated data or if its merely scavenging previously stolen or public information. For example, Mattel announced in November 2020, that it had been successfully hit by a ransomware attack earlier that year. The Stormous attackers could be simply compiling this already stolen data and packaging it as a new breach in an attempt to earn quick money.</li>

                                        <li>The group communicates through a Telegram channel and an .onion website on Tor. There is little chatter on the Telegram channel, with the conversation mainly comprised of the groups proclamations. While the group identifies itself as a ransomware group, it is not operating as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), and its not known what type of ransomware it may be using in their campaigns</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The Stormous group has also signaled that it wont stand by and allow other entities, such as ransomware groups, to attack Russia. Stormous has declared it will respond to any attack against Russia, noting that if the attacks on Russia stop then, Stormous will halt its efforts.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>As part of our regular Dark Web and cybercriminal research, Trustwave SpiderLabs has uncovered and analyzed postings from a politically motivated, pro-Russian ransomware group named Stormous. The group has recently proclaimed support for Russia in its war with Ukraine, attacking the Ukraine Ministry of Foreign Affairs and allegedly obtaining and making public phone numbers, email addresses, and national identity cards. But the group also claims to have a successful ransomware operation and has taken responsibility for cyber attacks on major American brands Coca-Cola, Mattel and Danaher. In total, Stormous claims to have already accessed and defaced 700 U.S. websites and attacked 44 American companies.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>There is some debate within the cybersecurity community on the validity of Stormous claims, specifically in relation to the Coca-Cola hack. The community questions whether or not the group has truly breached the companies named and exfiltrated data or if its merely scavenging previously stolen or public information. For example, Mattel announced in November 2020, that it had been successfully hit by a ransomware attack earlier that year. The Stormous attackers could be simply compiling this already stolen data and packaging it as a new breach in an attempt to earn quick money.</li>

But the group also claims to have a successful ransomware operation and has taken responsibility for cyber attacks on major American brands Coca-Cola, Mattel and Danaher. In total, Stormous claims to have already accessed and defaced 700 U.S. websites and attacked 44 American companies.</li>

The group has recently proclaimed support for Russia in its war with Ukraine, attacking the Ukraine Ministry of Foreign Affairs and allegedly obtaining and making public phone numbers, email addresses, and national identity cards. But the group also claims to have a successful ransomware operation and has taken responsibility for cyber attacks on major American brands Coca-Cola, Mattel and Danaher.

                                        <li>As part of our regular Dark Web and cybercriminal research, Trustwave SpiderLabs has uncovered and analyzed postings from a politically motivated, pro-Russian ransomware group named Stormous. The group has recently proclaimed support for Russia in its war with Ukraine, attacking the Ukraine Ministry of Foreign Affairs and allegedly obtaining and making public phone numbers, email addresses, and national identity cards. But the group also claims to have a successful ransomware operation and has taken responsibility for cyber attacks on major American brands Coca-Cola, Mattel and Danaher. In total, Stormous claims to have already accessed and defaced 700 U.S. websites and attacked 44 American companies.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The group's motivating principles and behavior somewhat resemble the Lapsus$ hacker group, which targets entities mainly in the Western hemisphere. Like Lapsus$, Stormous is quite loud online and looks to attract attention to itself, making splashy proclamations on the Dark Web and utilizing Telegram to communicate with its audience and organize to determine who to hack next.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Stormous announcement of the Coca-Cola data for sale and teasing new data dumps from other US companies</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Stormous logo wall of alleged victims</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The Stormous group has also signaled that it wont stand by and allow other entities, such as ransomware groups, to attack Russia. Stormous has declared it will respond to any attack against Russia, noting that if the attacks on Russia stop then, Stormous will halt its efforts.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Stormous is also representative of another recent trend that sees threat actors creating a "corporate-like" structure and business model. In this case, perhaps because Stormous is relatively new to the scene, its postings and communications appear to be a brand-building exercise. Also, by pre-announcing the availability of supposedly stolen data, the group is trying to hype demand as any company might do with a new product. Finally, by taking a political stance, it likely hopes to attract supporters with similar viewpoints.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Our initial analysis of Stormous indicates the gang likely has members located in Mid-Eastern countries and Russia. Some of the group's postings are written in Arabic along with its public pro-Russian stance, which is consistent with the region. Moreover, two of the group's members that were arrested were from mid-eastern countries.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>A message in Arabic from the Stormous Telegram channel stating it had attacked the Ukraine Ministry of Foreign Affairs</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Who Is Stormous and Where Does Its Allegiance Lie?</li>
                                    
                                        <li>A note from the Stormous Telegram channel</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The new style of threat group Stormous represents, being unafraid of -- and in fact seeking public adulation -- can make its members more susceptible to being found and arrested.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Stormous' actions are not unique. Since the Russia-Ukraine war started on Feb. 14, threat groups have been lining up to support each side. Trustwave SpiderLabs reported on this activity soon after hostilities broke out.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Stormous, which may have begun operating as early as mid-2021, has posted a mission statement stating its objective is to attack targets in the U.S. and other western nations. This goal shifted in 2022, adding Ukraine and India to its target list. The way they discuss countries as their targets as opposed to specific businesses or industries suggests that politics more influence these shifts in targets than financial gain.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Trustwave SpiderLabs will continue to track the threat of Stormous and groups activities as more information becomes available.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Stormous has already claimed responsibility for an alleged attack on the Coca-Cola Corp that it claims garnered 161GB of data. The group began selling the data on April 24 for 1.6 BTC, or about $64,000.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Stormous has posted its support for Russia and is claiming to have attacked the Ukraine Ministry of Foreign Affairs, obtaining and making public phone numbers, email addresses, and national identity cards. However, this attack, like the others, has not been corroborated.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Stormous has also claimed to have successfully attacked several targets in India and Saudi Arabia and possibly a Chinese government site.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Stormous official statement on its support for Russia</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Stormous has stated that on May 1, it will put up for sale data allegedly exfiltrated from toy manufacturer Mattel and Danaher, a global science and technology innovator. However, the group did not define the type or amount of data it had taken, and neither Mattel nor Danaher reported suffering a related cyber incident.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>There is some debate within the cybersecurity community on the validity of Stormous claims, specifically in relation to the Coca-Cola hack. The community questions whether or not the group has truly breached the companies named and exfiltrated data or if its merely scavenging previously stolen or public information. For example, Mattel announced in November 2020, that it had been successfully hit by a ransomware attack earlier that year. The Stormous attackers could be simply compiling this already stolen data and packaging it as a new breach in an attempt to earn quick money.</li>

                                        <li>There is some debate within the cybersecurity community on the validity of Stormous claims, specifically in relation to the Coca-Cola hack. The community questions whether or not the group has truly breached the companies named and exfiltrated data or if its merely scavenging previously stolen or public information. For example, Mattel announced in November 2020, that it had been successfully hit by a ransomware attack earlier that year. The Stormous attackers could be simply compiling this already stolen data and packaging it as a new breach in an attempt to earn quick money.</li>
