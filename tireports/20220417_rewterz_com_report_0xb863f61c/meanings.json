It steals user information from browsers, instant messaging applications, and file transfer protocol clients. According to the Proofpoint analysis, the malware first appeared in March 2020. Redline expanded throughout several nations during the COVID-19 epidemic and is still active today. Passwords, credit card information, cookies, usernames, locations, autofill data, and even hardware configuration such as keyboard layout, UAC settings can be stolen by RedLine. RedLine is also capable of stealing cryptocurrency. This malware is a live campaign that is aimed at a variety of Asian organizations."
