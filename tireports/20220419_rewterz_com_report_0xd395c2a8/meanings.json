The prioritized list allows administrators to focus on the most serious concerns and spend less time researching low-risk incidents. Suspicious actions are rated according to their seriousness. The timing of the event, related processes, executed command lines, file hashes, device, user, and more are all visible on the dashboard. Dashboards are beneficial because they make it simple to take additional action when diving into the specifics of a suspicious item by providing a context-aware list of further inquiry alternatives and rapid measures. A single-pane-of-glass view to all analytics also reduces the screen fatigue in analysts that arises from switching between multiple software and windows.",
