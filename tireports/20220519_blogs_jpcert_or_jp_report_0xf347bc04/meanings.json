These attack groups used the following 3 types of encoded malware loaded into the HUI Loader. Note that Poison Ivy and Quasar were customized by the attackers from the original.",
                        "HUI Loader has been used for a long time being updated little by little since about 2015. It is expected that attack groups continue to use it in the future. The IoC of HUI Loader introduced in this article is available on Github. Please use it as needed.",

The type that starts from the registry was identified around 2015, but it has not been seen in recent samples. The type that starts from the startup folder creates an LNK file in the startup folder and starts via a shortcut file, as shown in Figure 2.",

                        "To conceal malwares features, attackers sometimes encode the malware and decode it only when they execute it. In such cases, the encoded malware is loaded and executed by a program called loader. In this way, an attacker can split the malware into a loader and encoded malware. Minimizing the loaders features and hiding important features of the malware make detection on infected hosts more difficult. Among such loaders, this article discusses HUI Loader, which has been used since around 2015.",
