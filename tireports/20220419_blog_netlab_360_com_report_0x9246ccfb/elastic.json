Including the server IP of 156 domestic units, involving large central enterprises, government agencies and other industries.\nSpring manufacturers have disclosed three key vulnerabilities in a row, CVE-2022-22947, CVE-2022-22963, and CVE-2022-22965. This article will analyze the first two vulnerabilities in detail, and click here to view the details of the third vulnerability .\nMore than 800 million threat attacks were recorded this month (including more than 740 million vulnerability attacks and over 55 million malware spread), and more than 680,000 new IoCs were added. Among them, the vulnerability attacks targeting IoT devices are on the rise."
