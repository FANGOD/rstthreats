The file observed being delivered to victims is a remote access tool."

However, what makes Parrot TDS unique is its robustness and its huge reach, giving it the potential to infect millions of users. We identified increased activity of the Parrot TDS in February 2022 by detecting suspicious JavaScript files on compromised web servers. We analysed its behaviour and identified several versions, as well as several types of campaigns using Parrot TDS. Based on the appearance of the first samples and the registration date of the Command and Control (C2) domains it uses, Parrot TDS has been active since October 2021."

The tool basically gives the attacker full access to the victims machine. To run unnoticed, chat functions are disabled, and the silent option is set on the tool, for example. A gateway is also set up that allows the attacker to connect to the client from anywhere in the world. So far, weve seen Chinese domains in the tools configuration files used as gateways. The following picture below shows the client settings.",

Although the version we identified slightly differs from the 2018 version, the core remains the same. The user receives JavaScript that changes the appearance of the page and tries to force the user to download malicious code. An example of what such a page looks like is shown below.",
