As the price of cryptocurrency surges, and the popularity of non-fungible token (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi) businesses continues to swell, the Lazarus groups targeting of the financial industry keeps evolving.\nWe recently discovered a Trojanized DeFi application that was compiled in November 2021. This application contains a legitimate program called DeFi Wallet that saves and manages a cryptocurrency wallet, but also implants a malicious file when executed. This malware is a full-featured backdoor containing sufficient capabilities to control the compromised victim. After looking into the functionalities of this backdoor, we discovered numerous overlaps with other tools used by the Lazarus group.\nThe malware operator exclusively used compromised web servers located in South Korea for this attack. To take over the servers, we worked closely with the KrCERT and, as a result of this effort, we had an opportunity to investigate a Lazarus group C2 server. The threat actor configured this infrastructure with servers set up as multiple stages. The first stage is the source for the backdoor while the goal of the second stage servers is to communicate with the implants. This is a common scheme used in Lazarus infrastructure."

At first glance, it looked like a legitimate application related to decentralized finance (DeFi); however, looking closer we found it initiating an infection scheme. When executed, the app drops both a malicious file and an installer for a legitimate application, launching the malware with the created Trojanized installer path. Then, the spawned malware overwrites the legitimate application with the Trojanized application. Through this process, the Trojanized application gets removed from the disk, allowing it to cover its tracks.\nInfection timeline"

The hitherto unknown infection procedure starts with the Trojanized application. This installation package is disguised as a DeFi Wallet program containing a legitimate binary repackaged with the installer.\nUpon execution, it acquires the next stage malware path (C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\GoogleChrome.exe) and decrypts it with a one-byte XOR (Key: 0x5D). In the process of creating this next malware stage, the installer writes the first eight bytes including the MZ header to the file GoogleChrome.exe and pushes the remaining 71,164 bytes from the data section of the Trojanized application. Next, the malware loads the resource CITRIX_MEETINGS from its body and saves it to the path C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\CM202025.exe. The resulting file is a legitimate DeFi Wallet application. Eventually, it executes the previously created malware with its file name as a parameter:\nC:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\GoogleChrome.exe [current file name]\nMalware creation diagram"

Upon launch, the malware checks if it was provided with one argument before attempting to copy the legitimate application C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\CM202025.exe to the path given as the command line parameter, which means overwriting the original Trojanized installer, almost certainly in an attempt to conceal its prior existence. Next, the malware executes the legitimate file to deceive the victim by showing its benign installation process. When the user executes the newly installed program, it shows the DeFi Wallet software built with the public source code[1].\nScreenshot of the manipulated application\nNext, the malware starts initializing the configuration information. The configuration shows the structure shown in the table below, consisting of flags, C2 server addresses, victim identification value, and time value. As the structure suggests, this malware can hold up to five C2 addresses, but only three C2 servers are included in this case.\nThe malware randomly chooses a C2 server address and sends a beacon signal to it. This signal is a hard-coded 0x60D49D94 DWORD without encryption; the response data returned from the C2 carries the same value. If the expected value from the C2 server is received, the malware starts its backdoor operation.\nFollowing further communication with the C2, the malware encrypts data by a predefined method. The encryption is done via RC4 and the hard-coded key 0xD5A3 before additionally being encoded with base64.\nThe malware generates POST parameters with hard-coded names. The request type (msgID), victim identification value, and a randomly generated value are merged into the jsessid parameter. It also uses the cookie parameter to store four randomly generated four-byte values. These values are again encrypted with RC4 and additionally base64 encoded. Based on our investigation of the C2 script, we observed this malware not only uses a parameter named jsessid, but also jcookie as well.\nStructure of jsessid parameter\nThe following HTTP request shows the malware attempting to connect to the C2 with the request type 60d49d98 and a randomly generated cookie value.\nDepending on the response from the C2, the malware performs its instructed backdoor task. It carries various functionalities to gather system information and control the victim machine.",

After decoding, it shows the string 60d49d95 as an error response code, whereas the string 60d49d94 is used as a success message.

Depending on the msgID value, it calls different functions. The backdoor command and command execution result delivered by the backdoor get stored to global variables. We have seen this scheme in operation before with the Bookcode[2] cluster. This script uses the following variables as flags and buffers to deliver data and commands between the backdoor and a second stage C2 server:\nlFlag: flag to signal that there is data to deliver to the backdoor\nlBuffer: buffer to store data to be later sent to the backdoor\ntFlag: flag to signal that there is a response from the backdoor\ntBuffer: buffer to store incoming data from the backdoor",

The CookieTime cluster, called LCPDot by JPCERT, was a malwae cluster that was heavily used by the Lazarus group until recently. Weve seen Lazarus group target the defence industry using the CookieTime cluster with a job opportunity decoy. We have already published several reports about this cluster to our Threat Intelligence Service customers, and we identified a Trojanized Citrix application (5b831eaed711d5c4bc19d7e75fcaf46e) with the same code signature as the CookieTime malware. The backdoor discovered in the latest investigation, and the previously discovered Trojanized application, are almost identical. They share, among other things, the same C2 communication method, backdoor functionalities, random number generation routine and the same method to encrypt communication data. Also, this malware was mentioned in an article by Ahnlab discussing connections with the CookieTime (aka LCPDot) malware.\nSame backdoor switch of old CookieTime malware\nIn turn, we identified that the CookieTime cluster has ties with the Manuscrypt and ThreatNeedle clusters, which are also attributed to the Lazarus group. This doesnt only apply to the backdoor itself, but also to the C2 scripts, which show several overlaps with the ThreatNeedle cluster. We discovered almost all function and variable names, which means the operators recycled the code base and generated corresponding C2 scripts for the malware.\nAlmost identical scripts to fetch IP address of client\nSimilar scripts to save data to a file",

The cryptocurrency and blockchain-based industry continues to grow and attract high levels of investment. For this reason, we strongly believe Lazaruss interest in this industry as a major source of financial gain will not diminish any time soon."
