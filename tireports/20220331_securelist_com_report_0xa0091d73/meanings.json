                        "For the Lazarus threat actor, financial gain is one of the prime motivations, with a particular emphasis on the cryptocurrency business. As the price of cryptocurrency surges, and the popularity of non-fungible token (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi) businesses continues to swell, the Lazarus groups targeting of the financial industry keeps evolving.",
                        "We recently discovered a Trojanized DeFi application that was compiled in November 2021. This application contains a legitimate program called DeFi Wallet that saves and manages a cryptocurrency wallet, but also implants a malicious file when executed. This malware is a full-featured backdoor containing sufficient capabilities to control the compromised victim. After looking into the functionalities of this backdoor, we discovered numerous overlaps with other tools used by the Lazarus group.",

                        "In turn, we identified that the CookieTime cluster has ties with the Manuscrypt and ThreatNeedle clusters, which are also attributed to the Lazarus group. This doesnt only apply to the backdoor itself, but also to the C2 scripts, which show several overlaps with the ThreatNeedle cluster. We discovered almost all function and variable names, which means the operators recycled the code base and generated corresponding C2 scripts for the malware.",
                        "The script is a VBScript.Encode ASP file, commonly used by the Lazarus group in their C2 scripts. After decoding, it shows the string 60d49d95 as an error response code, whereas the string 60d49d94 is used as a success message. In addition, the connection history is saved to the file stlogo.jpg and the C2 address for the next stage is stored in the file globals.jpg located in the same folder.",
                        "The malware operator exclusively used compromised web servers located in South Korea for this attack. To take over the servers, we worked closely with the KrCERT and, as a result of this effort, we had an opportunity to investigate a Lazarus group C2 server. The threat actor configured this infrastructure with servers set up as multiple stages. The first stage is the source for the backdoor while the goal of the second stage servers is to communicate with the implants. This is a common scheme used in Lazarus infrastructure.",
                        "In a previous investigation we discovered that the BlueNoroff group, which is also linked to Lazarus, compromised another DeFi wallet program called MetaMask. As we can see in the latest case, the Lazarus and BlueNoroff groups attempt to deliver their malware without drawing attention to it and have evolved sophisticated methods to lure their victims. The cryptocurrency and blockchain-based industry continues to grow and attract high levels of investment. For this reason, we strongly believe Lazaruss interest in this industry as a major source of financial gain will not diminish any time soon.",
                        "We believe with high confidence that the Lazarus group is linked to this malware as we identified similar malware in the CookieTime cluster. The CookieTime cluster, called LCPDot by JPCERT, was a malwae cluster that was heavily used by the Lazarus group until recently. Weve seen Lazarus group target the defence industry using the CookieTime cluster with a job opportunity decoy. We have already published several reports about this cluster to our Threat Intelligence Service customers, and we identified a Trojanized Citrix application (5b831eaed711d5c4bc19d7e75fcaf46e) with the same code signature as the CookieTime malware. The backdoor discovered in the latest investigation, and the previously discovered Trojanized application, are almost identical. They share, among other things, the same C2 communication method, backdoor functionalities, random number generation routine and the same method to encrypt communication data. Also, this malware was mentioned in an article by Ahnlab discussing connections with the CookieTime (aka LCPDot) malware.",
                        "Lazarus only used compromised web servers located in South Korea in this campaign. As a result of working closely with the KrCERT in taking down some of them, we had a chance to look into the corresponding C2 script from one of the compromised servers. The script described in this section was discovered in the following path:",

The CookieTime cluster, called LCPDot by JPCERT, was a malwae cluster that was heavily used by the Lazarus group until recently. Weve seen Lazarus group target the defence industry using the CookieTime cluster with a job opportunity decoy. We have already published several reports about this cluster to our Threat Intelligence Service customers, and we identified a Trojanized Citrix application (5b831eaed711d5c4bc19d7e75fcaf46e) with the same code signature as the CookieTime malware. The backdoor discovered in the latest investigation, and the previously discovered Trojanized application, are almost identical. They share, among other things, the same C2 communication method, backdoor functionalities, random number generation routine and the same method to encrypt communication data. Also, this malware was mentioned in an article by Ahnlab discussing connections with the CookieTime (aka LCPDot) malware."

When executed, the app drops both a malicious file and an installer for a legitimate application, launching the malware with the created Trojanized installer path. Then, the spawned malware overwrites the legitimate application with the Trojanized application. Through this process, the Trojanized application gets removed from the disk, allowing it to cover its tracks.",

Weve seen Lazarus group target the defence industry using the CookieTime cluster with a job opportunity decoy. We have already published several reports about this cluster to our Threat Intelligence Service customers, and we identified a Trojanized Citrix application (5b831eaed711d5c4bc19d7e75fcaf46e) with the same code signature as the CookieTime malware. The backdoor discovered in the latest investigation, and the previously discovered Trojanized application, are almost identical. They share, among other things, the same C2 communication method, backdoor functionalities, random number generation routine and the same method to encrypt communication data.

                        "In the middle of December 2021, we noticed a suspicious file uploaded to VirusTotal. At first glance, it looked like a legitimate application related to decentralized finance (DeFi); however, looking closer we found it initiating an infection scheme. When executed, the app drops both a malicious file and an installer for a legitimate application, launching the malware with the created Trojanized installer path. Then, the spawned malware overwrites the legitimate application with the Trojanized application. Through this process, the Trojanized application gets removed from the disk, allowing it to cover its tracks.",
                        "In a previous investigation we discovered that the BlueNoroff group, which is also linked to Lazarus, compromised another DeFi wallet program called MetaMask. As we can see in the latest case, the Lazarus and BlueNoroff groups attempt to deliver their malware without drawing attention to it and have evolved sophisticated methods to lure their victims. The cryptocurrency and blockchain-based industry continues to grow and attract high levels of investment. For this reason, we strongly believe Lazaruss interest in this industry as a major source of financial gain will not diminish any time soon.",

The CookieTime cluster, called LCPDot by JPCERT, was a malwae cluster that was heavily used by the Lazarus group until recently. Weve seen Lazarus group target the defence industry using the CookieTime cluster with a job opportunity decoy. We have already published several reports about this cluster to our Threat Intelligence Service customers, and we identified a Trojanized Citrix application (5b831eaed711d5c4bc19d7e75fcaf46e) with the same code signature as the CookieTime malware. The backdoor discovered in the latest investigation, and the previously discovered Trojanized application, are almost identical. They share, among other things, the same C2 communication method, backdoor functionalities, random number generation routine and the same method to encrypt communication data. Also, this malware was mentioned in an article by Ahnlab discussing connections with the CookieTime (aka LCPDot) malware."

Next, the malware executes the legitimate file to deceive the victim by showing its benign installation process. When the user executes the newly installed program, it shows the DeFi Wallet software built with the public source code[1].",
                        "Upon execution, it acquires the next stage malware path (C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\GoogleChrome.exe) and decrypts it with a one-byte XOR (Key: 0x5D). In the process of creating this next malware stage, the installer writes the first eight bytes including the MZ header to the file GoogleChrome.exe and pushes the remaining 71,164 bytes from the data section of the Trojanized application. Next, the malware loads the resource CITRIX_MEETINGS from its body and saves it to the path C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\CM202025.exe. The resulting file is a legitimate DeFi Wallet application. Eventually, it executes the previously created malware with its file name as a parameter:"

To take over the servers, we worked closely with the KrCERT and, as a result of this effort, we had an opportunity to investigate a Lazarus group C2 server. The threat actor configured this infrastructure with servers set up as multiple stages. The first stage is the source for the backdoor while the goal of the second stage servers is to communicate with the implants. This is a common scheme used in Lazarus infrastructure."
