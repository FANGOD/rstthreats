In this March 2022 ransomware review, we go over some of the most successful ransomware incidents based on both open source and dark web intelligence.\nThe March data was consistent with the first two months of the year, and the most active ransomware gangs during this month continued to be LockBit, followed by Conti, with an increase in BlackCat (ALPHV), a suspected rebrand of the DarkSide & BlackMatter ransomware groups."

            "text": "Malwarebytes can protect systems against all ransomware variants in several ways.\nThe Malwarebytes Anti-Malware technology detects malicious files, browser modifications, and system modifications on Windows PCs using a combination of signature-based and signatureless technologies. This layer of protection detects the Ransomware binary itself. Detections can happen in real-time as the binary is run or the infection can be rooted out from an already-compromised machine by conducting a full system scan.\nAnti-Ransomware is a signatureless technology in charge of monitoring system activity of processes against a certain subset of data in specific locations on the endpoint. Using patented technology, Anti-Ransomware assesses changes in those data files. If an internal scoring threshold is crossed by a monitored process, it triggers a detection from the Anti-Ransomware component.\nFor those already infected, Ransomware Rollback can help recover encrypted files within 72 hours of the attack. Rollback creates a local cache on the endpoint to store changes to files on the system. It can use this cache to help revert changes caused by a threat. The Rollback feature is dependent on activity monitoring available in Malwarebytes Endpoint Detection and Response.\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nThreat Intelligence Team"
