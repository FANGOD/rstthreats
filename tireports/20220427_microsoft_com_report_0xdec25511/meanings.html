Reviewing the code flow for networkd-dispatcher revealed multiple security concerns, including directory traversal, symlink race, and time-of-check-time-of-use race condition issues, which could be leveraged to elevate privileges and deploy malware or carry out other malicious activities. We shared these vulnerabilities with the relevant maintainers through Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) via Microsoft Security Vulnerability Research (MSVR). Fixes for these vulnerabilities, now identified as CVE-2022-29799 and CVE-2022-29800, have been successfully deployed by the maintainer of the networkd-dispatcher, Clayton Craft. We wish to thank Clayton for his professionalism and collaboration in resolving those issues. Users of networkd-dispatcher are encouraged to update their instances.</li>

                                <li>When connecting to the D-Bus, components are assigned with a unique identifier, which mitigates against attacks abusing PID-recycling. The unique identifier starts with a colon and has numbers in it separated by dots, such as :1.337. Components can use the D-Bus API to own identifiable names such as org.freedesktop.Avahi or com.ubuntu.SystemService. For D-Bus to allow such ownership, the requesting process context must be allowed under the D-Bus configuration files. Those configuration files are well documented and maintained under /usr/local/share/dbus-1/system.conf and /usr/local/share/dbus-1/session.conf (on some systems under /usr/local/dbus-1 directly). Specifically, the default system.conf does not allow ownership unless specified otherwise in other included configuration files (commonly under /etc/dbus-1/system.d).</li>

                                <li>Prepare a directory /tmp/nimbuspwn and plant a symlink /tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d to point to /sbin. The /sbin directory was chosen specifically because it has many executables owned by root that do not block if run without additional arguments. This will abuse the symlink race issue we mentioned earlier.<br/>For every executable filename under /sbin owned by root, plant the same filename under /tmp/nimbuspwn. For example, if /sbin/vgs is executable and owned by root, plant an executable file /tmp/nimbuspwn/vgs with the desired payload. This will help the attacker win the race condition imposed by the TOCTOU vulnerability.<br/>Send a signal with the OperationalState ../../../tmp/nimbuspwn/poc. This abuses the directory traversal vulnerability and escapes the script directory.<br/>The networkd-dispatcher signal handler kicks in and builds the script list from the directory /etc/networkd-dispatcher/../../../tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d, which is really the symlink (/tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d), which points to /sbin. Therefore, it creates a list composed of many executables owned by root.<br/>Quickly change the symlink /tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d to point to /tmp/nimbuspwn. This abuses the TOCTOU race condition vulnerabilitythe script path changes without networkd-dispatcher being aware.<br/>The dispatcher starts running files that were initially under /sbin but in truth under the /tmp/nimbuspwn directory. Since the dispatcher believes those files are owned by root, it executes them blindly with subprocess.Popen as root. Therefore, our attacker has successfully exploited the vulnerability.</li>

                                        <li>Microsoft has discovered several vulnerabilities, collectively referred to as Nimbuspwn, that could allow an attacker to elevate privileges to root on many Linux desktop endpoints. The vulnerabilities can be chained together to gain root privileges on Linux systems, allowing attackers to deploy payloads, like a root backdoor, and perform other malicious actions via arbitrary root code execution. Moreover, the Nimbuspwn vulnerabilities could potentially be leveraged as a vector for root access by more sophisticated threats, such as malware or ransomware, to achieve greater impact on vulnerable devices.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>To address the specific vulnerabilities at play, Microsoft Defender for Endpoints endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities detect the directory traversal attack required to leverage Nimbuspwn. Additionally, the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detection team has a generic detection for suspicious Set-UID process invocations, which detected our exploit without prior knowledge.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Microsofts threat and vulnerability management capabilities help organizations monitor their overall security posture, providing real-time insights into risk with continuous vulnerability discovery, contextualized intelligent prioritization, and seamless one-click flaw remediation. Leveraging our research into the Nimbuspwn vulnerabilities to improve solutions, our threat and vulnerability management already covers CVE-2022-29799 and CVE-2022-29800 and indicates such vulnerable devices in the threat and vulnerability module in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Prepare a directory /tmp/nimbuspwn and plant a symlink /tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d to point to /sbin. The /sbin directory was chosen specifically because it has many executables owned by root that do not block if run without additional arguments. This will abuse the symlink race issue we mentioned earlier.<br/>For every executable filename under /sbin owned by root, plant the same filename under /tmp/nimbuspwn. For example, if /sbin/vgs is executable and owned by root, plant an executable file /tmp/nimbuspwn/vgs with the desired payload. This will help the attacker win the race condition imposed by the TOCTOU vulnerability.<br/>Send a signal with the OperationalState ../../../tmp/nimbuspwn/poc. This abuses the directory traversal vulnerability and escapes the script directory.<br/>The networkd-dispatcher signal handler kicks in and builds the script list from the directory /etc/networkd-dispatcher/../../../tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d, which is really the symlink (/tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d), which points to /sbin. Therefore, it creates a list composed of many executables owned by root.<br/>Quickly change the symlink /tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d to point to /tmp/nimbuspwn. This abuses the TOCTOU race condition vulnerabilitythe script path changes without networkd-dispatcher being aware.<br/>The dispatcher starts running files that were initially under /sbin but in truth under the /tmp/nimbuspwn directory. Since the dispatcher believes those files are owned by root, it executes them blindly with subprocess.Popen as root. Therefore, our attacker has successfully exploited the vulnerability.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>As organizational environments continue to rely on a diverse range of devices and systems, they require comprehensive solutions that provide cross-platform protection and a holistic view of their security posture to mitigate threats, such as Nimbuspwn. The growing number of vulnerabilities on Linux environments emphasize the need for strong monitoring of the platforms operating system and its components. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint enables organizations to gain this necessary visibility and detect such threats on Linux devices, allowing organizations to detect, manage, respond, and remediate vulnerabilities and threats across different platforms, including Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, and Android.</li>

                                        <li>Note that to win the TOCTOU race condition with high probability, we plant many files that can potentially run. Our experiments show three attempts were enough to win the TOCTOU race condition.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Prepare a directory /tmp/nimbuspwn and plant a symlink /tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d to point to /sbin. The /sbin directory was chosen specifically because it has many executables owned by root that do not block if run without additional arguments. This will abuse the symlink race issue we mentioned earlier.<br/>For every executable filename under /sbin owned by root, plant the same filename under /tmp/nimbuspwn. For example, if /sbin/vgs is executable and owned by root, plant an executable file /tmp/nimbuspwn/vgs with the desired payload. This will help the attacker win the race condition imposed by the TOCTOU vulnerability.<br/>Send a signal with the OperationalState ../../../tmp/nimbuspwn/poc. This abuses the directory traversal vulnerability and escapes the script directory.<br/>The networkd-dispatcher signal handler kicks in and builds the script list from the directory /etc/networkd-dispatcher/../../../tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d, which is really the symlink (/tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d), which points to /sbin. Therefore, it creates a list composed of many executables owned by root.<br/>Quickly change the symlink /tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d to point to /tmp/nimbuspwn. This abuses the TOCTOU race condition vulnerabilitythe script path changes without networkd-dispatcher being aware.<br/>The dispatcher starts running files that were initially under /sbin but in truth under the /tmp/nimbuspwn directory. Since the dispatcher believes those files are owned by root, it executes them blindly with subprocess.Popen as root. Therefore, our attacker has successfully exploited the vulnerability.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Directory traversal (CVE-2022-29799): none of the functions in the flow sanitize the OperationalState or the AdministrativeState. Since the states are used to build the script path, it is possible that a state would contain directory traversal patterns (e.g. ../../) to escape from the /etc/networkd-dispatcher base directory.<br/>Symlink race: both the script discovery and subprocess.Popen follow symbolic links.<br/>Time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition (CVE-2022-29800): there is a certain time between the scripts being discovered and them being run. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to replace scripts that networkd-dispatcher believes to be owned by root to ones that are not.</li>

                                        <li>Despite the evolving threat landscape regularly delivering new threats, techniques, and attack capabilities, adversaries continue to focus on identifying and taking advantage of unpatched vulnerabilities and misconfigurations as a vector to access systems, networks, and sensitive information for malicious purposes. This constant bombardment of attacks spanning a wide range of platforms, devices, and other domains emphasizes the need for a comprehensive and proactive vulnerability management approach that can further identify and mitigate even previously unknown exploits and issues.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>We discovered the vulnerabilities by listening to messages on the System Bus while performing code reviews and dynamic analysis on services that run as root, noticing an odd pattern in a systemd unit called networkd-dispatcher. Reviewing the code flow for networkd-dispatcher revealed multiple security concerns, including directory traversal, symlink race, and time-of-check-time-of-use race condition issues, which could be leveraged to elevate privileges and deploy malware or carry out other malicious activities. We shared these vulnerabilities with the relevant maintainers through Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) via Microsoft Security Vulnerability Research (MSVR). Fixes for these vulnerabilities, now identified as CVE-2022-29799 and CVE-2022-29800, have been successfully deployed by the maintainer of the networkd-dispatcher, Clayton Craft. We wish to thank Clayton for his professionalism and collaboration in resolving those issues. Users of networkd-dispatcher are encouraged to update their instances.</li>

The unique identifier starts with a colon and has numbers in it separated by dots, such as :1.337. Components can use the D-Bus API to own identifiable names such as org.freedesktop.Avahi or com.ubuntu.SystemService. For D-Bus to allow such ownership, the requesting process context must be allowed under the D-Bus configuration files. Those configuration files are well documented and maintained under /usr/local/share/dbus-1/system.conf and /usr/local/share/dbus-1/session.conf (on some systems under /usr/local/dbus-1 directly). Specifically, the default system.conf does not allow ownership unless specified otherwise in other included configuration files (commonly under /etc/dbus-1/system.d).</li>

The unique identifier starts with a colon and has numbers in it separated by dots, such as :1.337. Components can use the D-Bus API to own identifiable names such as org.freedesktop.Avahi or com.ubuntu.SystemService. For D-Bus to allow such ownership, the requesting process context must be allowed under the D-Bus configuration files. Those configuration files are well documented and maintained under /usr/local/share/dbus-1/system.conf and /usr/local/share/dbus-1/session.conf (on some systems under /usr/local/dbus-1 directly). Specifically, the default system.conf does not allow ownership unless specified otherwise in other included configuration files (commonly under /etc/dbus-1/system.d).</li>

                                        <li>The register function registers a new signal receiver for the service org.freedesktop.network1 on the System Bus, for the signal name PropertiesChanged.<br/>The _receive_signal signal handler will perform some basic checks on the object type being sent, concludes the changed network interface based on the object path being sent, and then concludes its new statesOperationalState and AdministrativeStateeach fetched from the data. For any of those statesif they arent emptythe handle_state method will get invoked.<br/>The handle_state method simply invokes _handle_one_state for each of those two states.<br/>_handle_one_state validates the state isnt empty and checks if its different than the previous state. If it is, it will update the new state and invoke the _run_hooks_for_state method, which is responsible of discovering and running the scripts for the new state.<br/>_run_hooks_for_state implements the following logic:Discovers the script list by invoking the get_script_list method (which gets the new state as a string). This method simply calls scripts_in_path which is intended to return all the files under /etc/networkd-dispatcher/<state>.d that are owned by the root user and the root group, and are executable. Sorts the script list. Runs each script with subprocess.Popen while supplying custom environment variables.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Directory traversal (CVE-2022-29799): none of the functions in the flow sanitize the OperationalState or the AdministrativeState. Since the states are used to build the script path, it is possible that a state would contain directory traversal patterns (e.g. ../../) to escape from the /etc/networkd-dispatcher base directory.<br/>Symlink race: both the script discovery and subprocess.Popen follow symbolic links.<br/>Time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition (CVE-2022-29800): there is a certain time between the scripts being discovered and them being run. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to replace scripts that networkd-dispatcher believes to be owned by root to ones that are not.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Prepare a directory /tmp/nimbuspwn and plant a symlink /tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d to point to /sbin. The /sbin directory was chosen specifically because it has many executables owned by root that do not block if run without additional arguments. This will abuse the symlink race issue we mentioned earlier.<br/>For every executable filename under /sbin owned by root, plant the same filename under /tmp/nimbuspwn. For example, if /sbin/vgs is executable and owned by root, plant an executable file /tmp/nimbuspwn/vgs with the desired payload. This will help the attacker win the race condition imposed by the TOCTOU vulnerability.<br/>Send a signal with the OperationalState ../../../tmp/nimbuspwn/poc. This abuses the directory traversal vulnerability and escapes the script directory.<br/>The networkd-dispatcher signal handler kicks in and builds the script list from the directory /etc/networkd-dispatcher/../../../tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d, which is really the symlink (/tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d), which points to /sbin. Therefore, it creates a list composed of many executables owned by root.<br/>Quickly change the symlink /tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d to point to /tmp/nimbuspwn. This abuses the TOCTOU race condition vulnerabilitythe script path changes without networkd-dispatcher being aware.<br/>The dispatcher starts running files that were initially under /sbin but in truth under the /tmp/nimbuspwn directory. Since the dispatcher believes those files are owned by root, it executes them blindly with subprocess.Popen as root. Therefore, our attacker has successfully exploited the vulnerability.</li>

Reviewing the code flow for networkd-dispatcher revealed multiple security concerns, including directory traversal, symlink race, and time-of-check-time-of-use race condition issues, which could be leveraged to elevate privileges and deploy malware or carry out other malicious activities. We shared these vulnerabilities with the relevant maintainers through Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) via Microsoft Security Vulnerability Research (MSVR). Fixes for these vulnerabilities, now identified as CVE-2022-29799 and CVE-2022-29800, have been successfully deployed by the maintainer of the networkd-dispatcher, Clayton Craft.

                                        <li>Our team has started enumerating services that run as root and listen to messages on the System Bus, performing both code reviews and dynamic analysis. We have reported two information leak issues as a result:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The register function registers a new signal receiver for the service org.freedesktop.network1 on the System Bus, for the signal name PropertiesChanged.<br/>The _receive_signal signal handler will perform some basic checks on the object type being sent, concludes the changed network interface based on the object path being sent, and then concludes its new statesOperationalState and AdministrativeStateeach fetched from the data. For any of those statesif they arent emptythe handle_state method will get invoked.<br/>The handle_state method simply invokes _handle_one_state for each of those two states.<br/>_handle_one_state validates the state isnt empty and checks if its different than the previous state. If it is, it will update the new state and invoke the _run_hooks_for_state method, which is responsible of discovering and running the scripts for the new state.<br/>_run_hooks_for_state implements the following logic:Discovers the script list by invoking the get_script_list method (which gets the new state as a string). This method simply calls scripts_in_path which is intended to return all the files under /etc/networkd-dispatcher/<state>.d that are owned by the root user and the root group, and are executable. Sorts the script list. Runs each script with subprocess.Popen while supplying custom environment variables.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>D-Bus exposes a global System Bus and a per-session Session Bus. From an attackers perspective, the System Bus is more attractive since it will commonly have services that run as root listening to it.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>We discovered the vulnerabilities by listening to messages on the System Bus while performing code reviews and dynamic analysis on services that run as root, noticing an odd pattern in a systemd unit called networkd-dispatcher. Reviewing the code flow for networkd-dispatcher revealed multiple security concerns, including directory traversal, symlink race, and time-of-check-time-of-use race condition issues, which could be leveraged to elevate privileges and deploy malware or carry out other malicious activities. We shared these vulnerabilities with the relevant maintainers through Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) via Microsoft Security Vulnerability Research (MSVR).

Since the states are used to build the script path, it is possible that a state would contain directory traversal patterns (e.g. ../../) to escape from the /etc/networkd-dispatcher base directory.<br/>Symlink race: both the script discovery and subprocess.Popen follow symbolic links.<br/>Time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition (CVE-2022-29800): there is a certain time between the scripts being discovered and them being run. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to replace scripts that networkd-dispatcher believes to be owned by root to ones that are not.</li>

The /sbin directory was chosen specifically because it has many executables owned by root that do not block if run without additional arguments. This will abuse the symlink race issue we mentioned earlier.<br/>For every executable filename under /sbin owned by root, plant the same filename under /tmp/nimbuspwn. For example, if /sbin/vgs is executable and owned by root, plant an executable file /tmp/nimbuspwn/vgs with the desired payload. This will help the attacker win the race condition imposed by the TOCTOU vulnerability.<br/>Send a signal with the OperationalState ../../../tmp/nimbuspwn/poc. This abuses the directory traversal vulnerability and escapes the script directory.<br/>The networkd-dispatcher signal handler kicks in and builds the script list from the directory /etc/networkd-dispatcher/../../../tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d, which is really the symlink (/tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d), which points to /sbin. Therefore, it creates a list composed of many executables owned by root.<br/>Quickly change the symlink /tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d to point to /tmp/nimbuspwn. This abuses the TOCTOU race condition vulnerabilitythe script path changes without networkd-dispatcher being aware.<br/>The dispatcher starts running files that were initially under /sbin but in truth under the /tmp/nimbuspwn directory. Since the dispatcher believes those files are owned by root, it executes them blindly with subprocess.Popen as root. Therefore, our attacker has successfully exploited the vulnerability.</li>

                                        <li>We discovered the vulnerabilities by listening to messages on the System Bus while performing code reviews and dynamic analysis on services that run as root, noticing an odd pattern in a systemd unit called networkd-dispatcher. Reviewing the code flow for networkd-dispatcher revealed multiple security concerns, including directory traversal, symlink race, and time-of-check-time-of-use race condition issues, which could be leveraged to elevate privileges and deploy malware or carry out other malicious activities. We shared these vulnerabilities with the relevant maintainers through Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) via Microsoft Security Vulnerability Research (MSVR). Fixes for these vulnerabilities, now identified as CVE-2022-29799 and CVE-2022-29800, have been successfully deployed by the maintainer of the networkd-dispatcher, Clayton Craft.

The /sbin directory was chosen specifically because it has many executables owned by root that do not block if run without additional arguments. This will abuse the symlink race issue we mentioned earlier.<br/>For every executable filename under /sbin owned by root, plant the same filename under /tmp/nimbuspwn. For example, if /sbin/vgs is executable and owned by root, plant an executable file /tmp/nimbuspwn/vgs with the desired payload. This will help the attacker win the race condition imposed by the TOCTOU vulnerability.<br/>Send a signal with the OperationalState ../../../tmp/nimbuspwn/poc. This abuses the directory traversal vulnerability and escapes the script directory.<br/>The networkd-dispatcher signal handler kicks in and builds the script list from the directory /etc/networkd-dispatcher/../../../tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d, which is really the symlink (/tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d), which points to /sbin. Therefore, it creates a list composed of many executables owned by root.<br/>Quickly change the symlink /tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d to point to /tmp/nimbuspwn. This abuses the TOCTOU race condition vulnerabilitythe script path changes without networkd-dispatcher being aware.<br/>The dispatcher starts running files that were initially under /sbin but in truth under the /tmp/nimbuspwn directory. Since the dispatcher believes those files are owned by root, it executes them blindly with subprocess.Popen as root. Therefore, our attacker has successfully exploited the vulnerability.</li>

                                        <li>We discovered the vulnerabilities by listening to messages on the System Bus while performing code reviews and dynamic analysis on services that run as root, noticing an odd pattern in a systemd unit called networkd-dispatcher. Reviewing the code flow for networkd-dispatcher revealed multiple security concerns, including directory traversal, symlink race, and time-of-check-time-of-use race condition issues, which could be leveraged to elevate privileges and deploy malware or carry out other malicious activities. We shared these vulnerabilities with the relevant maintainers through Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) via Microsoft Security Vulnerability Research (MSVR). Fixes for these vulnerabilities, now identified as CVE-2022-29799 and CVE-2022-29800, have been successfully deployed by the maintainer of the networkd-dispatcher, Clayton Craft. We wish to thank Clayton for his professionalism and collaboration in resolving those issues. Users of networkd-dispatcher are encouraged to update their instances.</li>

                                        <li>We discovered the vulnerabilities by listening to messages on the System Bus while performing code reviews and dynamic analysis on services that run as root, noticing an odd pattern in a systemd unit called networkd-dispatcher. Reviewing the code flow for networkd-dispatcher revealed multiple security concerns, including directory traversal, symlink race, and time-of-check-time-of-use race condition issues, which could be leveraged to elevate privileges and deploy malware or carry out other malicious activities. We shared these vulnerabilities with the relevant maintainers through Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) via Microsoft Security Vulnerability Research (MSVR). Fixes for these vulnerabilities, now identified as CVE-2022-29799 and CVE-2022-29800, have been successfully deployed by the maintainer of the networkd-dispatcher, Clayton Craft. We wish to thank Clayton for his professionalism and collaboration in resolving those issues.

                                        <li>Let us assume an adversary has a malicious D-Bus component that can send an arbitrary signal. An attacker can therefore do the following:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>When connecting to the D-Bus, components are assigned with a unique identifier, which mitigates against attacks abusing PID-recycling. The unique identifier starts with a colon and has numbers in it separated by dots, such as :1.337. Components can use the D-Bus API to own identifiable names such as org.freedesktop.Avahi or com.ubuntu.SystemService. For D-Bus to allow such ownership, the requesting process context must be allowed under the D-Bus configuration files. Those configuration files are well documented and maintained under /usr/local/share/dbus-1/system.conf and /usr/local/share/dbus-1/session.conf (on some systems under /usr/local/dbus-1 directly). Specifically, the default system.conf does not allow ownership unless specified otherwise in other included configuration files (commonly under /etc/dbus-1/system.d).</li>
                                    
                                        <li>D-Bus exposes a global System Bus and a per-session Session Bus. From an attackers perspective, the System Bus is more attractive since it will commonly have services that run as root listening to it.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>There are many D-Bus components shipped by default on popular Linux desktop environments. Since those components run at different privileges and respond to messages, D-Bus components are an attractive target for attackers. Indeed, there have been interesting vulnerabilities in the past related to buggy D-Bus services, including USBCreator Elevation of Privilege, Blueman Elevation of Privilege by command injection, and other similar scenarios.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>An example of D-Bus usage would be receiving a video chat by a popular video conferencing apponce a video is established, the video conferencing app could send a D-bus signal publishing that a call has started. Apps listening to that message could respond appropriatelyfor example, mute their audio.</li>

The unique identifier starts with a colon and has numbers in it separated by dots, such as :1.337. Components can use the D-Bus API to own identifiable names such as org.freedesktop.Avahi or com.ubuntu.SystemService. For D-Bus to allow such ownership, the requesting process context must be allowed under the D-Bus configuration files. Those configuration files are well documented and maintained under /usr/local/share/dbus-1/system.conf and /usr/local/share/dbus-1/session.conf (on some systems under /usr/local/dbus-1 directly). Specifically, the default system.conf does not allow ownership unless specified otherwise in other included configuration files (commonly under /etc/dbus-1/system.d).</li>

                                        <li>Prepare a directory /tmp/nimbuspwn and plant a symlink /tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d to point to /sbin. The /sbin directory was chosen specifically because it has many executables owned by root that do not block if run without additional arguments. This will abuse the symlink race issue we mentioned earlier.<br/>For every executable filename under /sbin owned by root, plant the same filename under /tmp/nimbuspwn. For example, if /sbin/vgs is executable and owned by root, plant an executable file /tmp/nimbuspwn/vgs with the desired payload. This will help the attacker win the race condition imposed by the TOCTOU vulnerability.<br/>Send a signal with the OperationalState ../../../tmp/nimbuspwn/poc. This abuses the directory traversal vulnerability and escapes the script directory.<br/>The networkd-dispatcher signal handler kicks in and builds the script list from the directory /etc/networkd-dispatcher/../../../tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d, which is really the symlink (/tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d), which points to /sbin. Therefore, it creates a list composed of many executables owned by root.<br/>Quickly change the symlink /tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d to point to /tmp/nimbuspwn. This abuses the TOCTOU race condition vulnerabilitythe script path changes without networkd-dispatcher being aware.<br/>The dispatcher starts running files that were initially under /sbin but in truth under the /tmp/nimbuspwn directory. Since the dispatcher believes those files are owned by root, it executes them blindly with subprocess.Popen as root. Therefore, our attacker has successfully exploited the vulnerability.</li>

For any of those statesif they arent emptythe handle_state method will get invoked.<br/>The handle_state method simply invokes _handle_one_state for each of those two states.<br/>_handle_one_state validates the state isnt empty and checks if its different than the previous state. If it is, it will update the new state and invoke the _run_hooks_for_state method, which is responsible of discovering and running the scripts for the new state.<br/>_run_hooks_for_state implements the following logic:Discovers the script list by invoking the get_script_list method (which gets the new state as a string). This method simply calls scripts_in_path which is intended to return all the files under /etc/networkd-dispatcher/<state>.d that are owned by the root user and the root group, and are executable. Sorts the script list. Runs each script with subprocess.Popen while supplying custom environment variables.</li>

The /sbin directory was chosen specifically because it has many executables owned by root that do not block if run without additional arguments. This will abuse the symlink race issue we mentioned earlier.<br/>For every executable filename under /sbin owned by root, plant the same filename under /tmp/nimbuspwn. For example, if /sbin/vgs is executable and owned by root, plant an executable file /tmp/nimbuspwn/vgs with the desired payload. This will help the attacker win the race condition imposed by the TOCTOU vulnerability.<br/>Send a signal with the OperationalState ../../../tmp/nimbuspwn/poc. This abuses the directory traversal vulnerability and escapes the script directory.<br/>The networkd-dispatcher signal handler kicks in and builds the script list from the directory /etc/networkd-dispatcher/../../../tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d, which is really the symlink (/tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d), which points to /sbin. Therefore, it creates a list composed of many executables owned by root.<br/>Quickly change the symlink /tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d to point to /tmp/nimbuspwn. This abuses the TOCTOU race condition vulnerabilitythe script path changes without networkd-dispatcher being aware.<br/>The dispatcher starts running files that were initially under /sbin but in truth under the /tmp/nimbuspwn directory. Since the dispatcher believes those files are owned by root, it executes them blindly with subprocess.Popen as root. Therefore, our attacker has successfully exploited the vulnerability.</li>

The /sbin directory was chosen specifically because it has many executables owned by root that do not block if run without additional arguments. This will abuse the symlink race issue we mentioned earlier.<br/>For every executable filename under /sbin owned by root, plant the same filename under /tmp/nimbuspwn. For example, if /sbin/vgs is executable and owned by root, plant an executable file /tmp/nimbuspwn/vgs with the desired payload. This will help the attacker win the race condition imposed by the TOCTOU vulnerability.<br/>Send a signal with the OperationalState ../../../tmp/nimbuspwn/poc. This abuses the directory traversal vulnerability and escapes the script directory.<br/>The networkd-dispatcher signal handler kicks in and builds the script list from the directory /etc/networkd-dispatcher/../../../tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d, which is really the symlink (/tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d), which points to /sbin. Therefore, it creates a list composed of many executables owned by root.<br/>Quickly change the symlink /tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d to point to /tmp/nimbuspwn. This abuses the TOCTOU race condition vulnerabilitythe script path changes without networkd-dispatcher being aware.<br/>The dispatcher starts running files that were initially under /sbin but in truth under the /tmp/nimbuspwn directory. Since the dispatcher believes those files are owned by root, it executes them blindly with subprocess.Popen as root. Therefore, our attacker has successfully exploited the vulnerability.</li>

Therefore, it creates a list composed of many executables owned by root.<br/>Quickly change the symlink /tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d to point to /tmp/nimbuspwn. This abuses the TOCTOU race condition vulnerabilitythe script path changes without networkd-dispatcher being aware.<br/>The dispatcher starts running files that were initially under /sbin but in truth under the /tmp/nimbuspwn directory. Since the dispatcher believes those files are owned by root, it executes them blindly with subprocess.Popen as root. Therefore, our attacker has successfully exploited the vulnerability.</li>
