Using the vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on a remote web server, which makes CVE-2022-22965 a critical threat, given the Spring frameworks popularity. By analogy with the infamous Log4Shell threat, the vulnerability was named Spring4Shell."

            "text": "CVE-2022-22965 (Spring4Shell, SpringShell) is a vulnerability in the Spring Framework that uses data binding functionality to bind data stored within an HTTP request to certain objects used by an application. The bug exists in the getCachedIntrospectionResults method, which can be used to gain unauthorized access to such objects by passing their class names via an HTTP request. It creates the risks of data leakage and remote code execution when special object classes are used. This vulnerability is similar to the long-closed CVE-2010-1622, where class name checks were added as a fix so that the name did not match classLoader or protectionDomain. However, in a newer version of JDK an alternative method exists for such exploitation, for example, through Java 9 Platform Module System functionality.\nSo an attacker can overwrite the Tomcat logging configuration and then upload a JSP web shell to execute arbitrary commands on a server running a vulnerable version of the framework.\nA vulnerable configuration consists of:\nJDK version 9+\nApache Tomcat for serving the application\nSpring Framework versions 5.3.0 to 5.3.17 and 5.2.0 to 5.2.19 and below\napplication built as a WAR file\nCVE-2022-22963 is a vulnerability in the routing functionality of Spring Cloud Function that allows code injection through Spring Expression Language (SpEL) by adding a special spring.cloud.function.routing-expression header to an HTTP request. SpEL is a special expression language created for Spring Framework that supports queries and object graph management at runtime. This vulnerability can also be used for remote code execution.\nA vulnerable configuration consists of:\nSpring Cloud Function 3.1.6, 3.2.2 and older versions"
