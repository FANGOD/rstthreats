                        "CVE-2022-22965 (Spring4Shell, SpringShell) is a vulnerability in the Spring Framework that uses data binding functionality to bind data stored within an HTTP request to certain objects used by an application. The bug exists in the getCachedIntrospectionResults method, which can be used to gain unauthorized access to such objects by passing their class names via an HTTP request. It creates the risks of data leakage and remote code execution when special object classes are used. This vulnerability is similar to the long-closed CVE-2010-1622, where class name checks were added as a fix so that the name did not match classLoader or protectionDomain. However, in a newer version of JDK an alternative method exists for such exploitation, for example, through Java 9 Platform Module System functionality.<crlf>So an attacker can overwrite the Tomcat logging configuration and then upload a JSP web shell to execute arbitrary commands on a server running a vulnerable version of the framework."

                        "CVE-2022-22965 (Spring4Shell, SpringShell) is a vulnerability in the Spring Framework that uses data binding functionality to bind data stored within an HTTP request to certain objects used by an application. The bug exists in the getCachedIntrospectionResults method, which can be used to gain unauthorized access to such objects by passing their class names via an HTTP request. It creates the risks of data leakage and remote code execution when special object classes are used. This vulnerability is similar to the long-closed CVE-2010-1622, where class name checks were added as a fix so that the name did not match classLoader or protectionDomain. However, in a newer version of JDK an alternative method exists for such exploitation, for example, through Java 9 Platform Module System functionality.<crlf>So an attacker can overwrite the Tomcat logging configuration and then upload a JSP web shell to execute arbitrary commands on a server running a vulnerable version of the framework."

                        "CVE-2022-22965 (Spring4Shell, SpringShell) is a vulnerability in the Spring Framework that uses data binding functionality to bind data stored within an HTTP request to certain objects used by an application. The bug exists in the getCachedIntrospectionResults method, which can be used to gain unauthorized access to such objects by passing their class names via an HTTP request. It creates the risks of data leakage and remote code execution when special object classes are used. This vulnerability is similar to the long-closed CVE-2010-1622, where class name checks were added as a fix so that the name did not match classLoader or protectionDomain. However, in a newer version of JDK an alternative method exists for such exploitation, for example, through Java 9 Platform Module System functionality.<crlf>So an attacker can overwrite the Tomcat logging configuration and then upload a JSP web shell to execute arbitrary commands on a server running a vulnerable version of the framework."
