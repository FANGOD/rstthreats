When you look into what happened, you can actually see the data flow wipers, which are like destructive tools only made to completely destroy your computer. Not a thing you want lying around your network. They use two of them. Actually, one of them is called Deadwood., which was actually deployed in the past against the target in Saudi Arabia in 2019. That's also an interesting fact in the context of the attribution because deadwood was attributed to Iran in the past during twenty eighteen, and the version that they use is an updated version of the version that was used in the attacks in 2019, indicating that they have access to the code itself. They're not like just, I don't know, download it from anywhere or something like that. And they also used another wiper, which was not very much successful in its work. It didn't work. Yeah, it was quite badly written. Like, it seems like two guys were sitting in the room and they were like, Yeah, let's write a wiper. Let's take chunks of code from the IP stack helper and just make something work. And they wrote it like really quickly. And they didn't do it quite well because the way it searches for files to wipe has some sort of logic flaws, which makes it, uh, not work.</p>"
