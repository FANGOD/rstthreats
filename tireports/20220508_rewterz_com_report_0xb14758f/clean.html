<h2>Analysis Summary</h2>
<h4>CVE‑2022‑28193, CVSS 7.3</h4>
<p>
NVIDIA Jetson Linux Driver Package contains a vulnerability in the Cboot module tegrabl_cbo.c, where insufficient validation of untrusted data may allow a local attacker to cause a memory buffer overflow, which may lead to code execution, loss of integrity, limited denial of service, and some impact to confidentiality.</p>
<h4>CVE‑2022‑28194, CVSS 7.3</h4>
<p>
NVIDIA Jetson Linux Driver Package contains a vulnerability in the Cboot module tegrabl_cbo.c, where, if TFTP is enabled, a local attacker can cause a memory buffer overflow, which may lead to code execution, loss of Integrity, limited denial of service, and some impact on confidentiality.</p>
<h4>CVE‑2022‑28195, CVSS 5.7</h4>
<p>
NVIDIA Jetson Linux Driver Package contains a vulnerability in the Cboot ext4_read_file function, where insufficient validation of untrusted data may allow a highly privileged local attacker to cause an integer overflow, which may lead to code execution, escalation of privileges, limited denial of service, and some impact to confidentiality and integrity.</p>
<h4>CVE‑2022‑28196, CVSS 5.7</h4>
<p>
NVIDIA Jetson Linux Driver Package contains a vulnerability in the Cboot blob_decompress function, where insufficient validation of untrusted data may allow a local attacker to cause a memory buffer overflow, which may lead to code execution, limited loss of Integrity, and limited denial of service.</p>
<h4>CVE‑2022‑28197, CVSS 5.0</h4>
<p>
NVIDIA Jetson Linux Driver Package contains a vulnerability in the Cboot ext4_mount function, where Insufficient validation of untrusted data may allow a highly privileged local attacker to cause an integer overflow. This difficult-to-exploit vulnerability may lead to code execution, escalation of privileges, limited denial of service, and some impact on confidentiality and integrity.</p>
