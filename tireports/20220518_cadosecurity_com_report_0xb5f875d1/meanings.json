                        "Dynamic linker hijacking is often utilised by Linux malware to install rootkits on the target system. One popular open source rootkit is libprocesshider.so. As the name suggests, libprocesshider is used to hide processes from Linux performance monitoring tools, such as top, ps, lsof and so on. It achieves this by hooking syscalls used for enumerating the /proc/<PID> directories and preventing them from doing so (more info here). Naturally, this is desirable for virtually all categories of malware, as malicious processes may be able to execute unimpeded if they are undetectable by the bundled monitoring tools.",
                        "Similarly, the /etc/ld.so.preload file shouldnt exist in a vanilla installation of Linux. If this file exists and it contains paths to arbitrary executables, this is again indicative of malicious libraries being used. Simply delete the file to prevent the libraries being loaded in future and remove the libraries themselves.",
                        "As a result, the miner executes uninterrupted and successfully generates profits for the malware developer.",
                        "At Cado Labs, we regularly analyse malware campaigns targeting Linux and have decided to document some common and not-so-common attack techniques observed in these campaigns. We hope this will help defenders identify and mitigate these techniques in their Linux environments. In this blog were going to analyse a common method of execution flow hijacking on Linux: dynamic linker hijacking.",
                        "However, if we think like an attacker, shared libraries present an opportunity to hijack the execution flow of an application and run malicious code in the context of a legitimate process. Generally, dynamic linker hijacking involves tricking the dynamic linker into loading a malicious library implanted by the attacker.",
                        "Linux has long dominated the server computing landscape, and the rapid adoption of cloud technologies by organisations around the world has only contributed to this. As a result, many recent high-profile malware campaigns have targeted Linux servers (often in cloud environments) and used them to illicitly mine cryptocurrency, conduct denial of service (DoS) attacks, steal sensitive data and carry out other nefarious activities.",
                        "Essentially, this means that shortly after invocation, the dynamic linker will read the contents of $LD_PRELOAD and load any shared objects located at paths defined in the envar before any other (potentially benign) shared objects are loaded. Since its easy for a malicious shell script or other executable to set the value of LD_PRELOAD, you can see how this could be leveraged by malware to run additional payloads.",
                        "Although effective, fortunately this technique is relatively easy to detect on Linux. To check the contents of the LD_PRELOAD envar, the export command can be used. If you suspect your system has been compromised and this envar is set then its likely that a malicious library has been used. The unset command can be used to delete the value of the envar and reveal the malware if a process hiding library was used.",
                        "This can be used to supplement existing payloads by implementing features like process hiding, as well discuss later. It also brings stealth benefits to a malware campaign and although many modern operating systems are hardened to prevent arbitrary libraries from being loaded, this is still a highly-effective technique and one which is often seen in the wild.",

When a developer compiles an executable, they specify which libraries should be loaded and the operating systems linker retrieves these and loads them when the application is launched.

                        "Dynamic linker hijacking is often utilised by Linux malware to install rootkits on the target system. One popular open source rootkit is libprocesshider.so. As the name suggests, libprocesshider is used to hide processes from Linux performance monitoring tools, such as top, ps, lsof and so on. It achieves this by hooking syscalls used for enumerating the /proc/<PID> directories and preventing them from doing so (more info here). Naturally, this is desirable for virtually all categories of malware, as malicious processes may be able to execute unimpeded if they are undetectable by the bundled monitoring tools.",

                        "At Cado Labs, we regularly analyse malware campaigns targeting Linux and have decided to document some common and not-so-common attack techniques observed in these campaigns. We hope this will help defenders identify and mitigate these techniques in their Linux environments. In this blog were going to analyse a common method of execution flow hijacking on Linux: dynamic linker hijacking.",
                        "Dynamic linking, a feature present in virtually all modern operating systems, allows certain commonly-used libraries (referred to as shared objects in Linux, dylibs in macOS, and Dynamic Linked Libraries/DLLs in Windows) to be loaded by an application at runtime. When a developer compiles an executable, they specify which libraries should be loaded and the operating systems linker retrieves these and loads them when the application is launched. This allows the code contained within the libraries to be shared across applications and saves the developer writing this code and shipping it themselves.",

                        "Essentially, this means that shortly after invocation, the dynamic linker will read the contents of $LD_PRELOAD and load any shared objects located at paths defined in the envar before any other (potentially benign) shared objects are loaded. Since its easy for a malicious shell script or other executable to set the value of LD_PRELOAD, you can see how this could be leveraged by malware to run additional payloads.",
                        "In Linux, the dynamic linkers are referred to as ld.so and ld-linux.so. The latter is commonly used in contemporary Linux distributions as it handles dynamic linking for executables in the ELF binary format the current default format on Linux.<crlf>A number of environment variables (envars) can be used during the execution of the dynamic linker, the most important of which (for our purposes) is LD_PRELOAD. From the ld.so man page:",
                        "However, if we think like an attacker, shared libraries present an opportunity to hijack the execution flow of an application and run malicious code in the context of a legitimate process. Generally, dynamic linker hijacking involves tricking the dynamic linker into loading a malicious library implanted by the attacker.",

The dynamic linker also consults the file /etc/ld.so.preload which can also contain user-specified paths to shared objects. In the case that paths are defined both in the envar and in this file, the envar takes precedence. Additionally, the ld.so.preload file causes a system-wide configuration change, resulting in shared objects being preloaded by any binary on the system."

                        "Dynamic linker hijacking is often utilised by Linux malware to install rootkits on the target system. One popular open source rootkit is libprocesshider.so. As the name suggests, libprocesshider is used to hide processes from Linux performance monitoring tools, such as top, ps, lsof and so on. It achieves this by hooking syscalls used for enumerating the /proc/<PID> directories and preventing them from doing so (more info here). Naturally, this is desirable for virtually all categories of malware, as malicious processes may be able to execute unimpeded if they are undetectable by the bundled monitoring tools.",

We hope this will help defenders identify and mitigate these techniques in their Linux environments. In this blog were going to analyse a common method of execution flow hijacking on Linux: dynamic linker hijacking.",
                        "Dynamic linking, a feature present in virtually all modern operating systems, allows certain commonly-used libraries (referred to as shared objects in Linux, dylibs in macOS, and Dynamic Linked Libraries/DLLs in Windows) to be loaded by an application at runtime. When a developer compiles an executable, they specify which libraries should be loaded and the operating systems linker retrieves these and loads them when the application is launched. This allows the code contained within the libraries to be shared across applications and saves the developer writing this code and shipping it themselves.",

                        "Although effective, fortunately this technique is relatively easy to detect on Linux. To check the contents of the LD_PRELOAD envar, the export command can be used. If you suspect your system has been compromised and this envar is set then its likely that a malicious library has been used. The unset command can be used to delete the value of the envar and reveal the malware if a process hiding library was used.",
                        "The LD_PRELOAD envar is not the only place where users can specify shared objects to be loaded first. The dynamic linker also consults the file /etc/ld.so.preload which can also contain user-specified paths to shared objects. In the case that paths are defined both in the envar and in this file, the envar takes precedence. Additionally, the ld.so.preload file causes a system-wide configuration change, resulting in shared objects being preloaded by any binary on the system.",
