GuLoader downloads the bulk of malware, with the most frequent being AgentTesla, FormBook, and NanoCore. The encrypted payloads of this downloader are usually saved on Google Drive. It also got its payloads from Microsoft OneDrive and websites that were controlled by an attacker. GuLoader can avoid network-based detection by using genuine file-sharing websites, which arent often filtered or inspected in corporate contexts."
