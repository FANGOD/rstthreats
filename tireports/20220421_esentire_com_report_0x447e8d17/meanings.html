                                        <li>Thus far, in the current more_eggs campaign, the eSentire TRU team has discovered and shut down four separate security incidents. Three of them occurred at the end of March, and they all involve the new variant of more_eggs. The organizations attacked include a U.S.-based aerospace/defense company that designs, develops and provides maintenance repair for airline components; a large UK-based CPA firm; an international business law firm based out of Canada; and a national Canadian staffing agency.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Of course, for a threat group to get a foothold into the IT environments of an aerospace/ defense company, an international law firm, an international CPA firm and a national corporate staffing agency could be very lucrative. Successfully infecting a corporate employee with the more_eggs malware could potentially enable a threat actor(s) to commit a variety of cybercrimes including deploying ransomware, stealing intellectual property, stealing credentials to corporate bank accounts, or committing business email compromise, among others.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>A more_eggs malware campaign has appeared, just as it did last year during the Easter season. eSentires Threat Response Unit (TRU) security research team has discovered a phishing campaign where hackers are posing as job applicants and luring Corporate Hiring Managers into downloading what they believe are resumes from job applicants. However, the bogus resumes contain the more_eggs malware.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Since these more_eggs attacks were disrupted, the TRU team cannot know with certainty what the end game is for this operation or what threat group is behind these attacks. What we do know is that this current activity demonstrates a role-reversal from last years more_eggs LinkedIn campaign. We also know that the more_eggs Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) is known to be utilized by the very capable FIN6, Evilnum<br/>and Cobalt<br/>cybercriminals.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Cobalt Group - The Cobalt Group is also known to go after financial companies, and it has repeatedly used the more_eggs backdoor in their attacks.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Anti-Virus(AV) is not enough to protect employees and home users from cyber threats. Because malware like more_eggs takes the so-called fileless approach to evade AV, there is no malicious executable for AV to detect. Rather, more_eggs achieves execution by passing malicious code to legitimate windows processes and letting those windows processes do the work for them.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>For example, if the LinkedIn members job is listed as Senior Account ExecutiveInternational Freight, the malicious zip file would be titled Senior Account Executive International Freight position. Upon opening the fake job offer, the victim unwittingly initiated the installation of more_eggs.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>eSentires<br/>security research team, the Threat Response Unit (TRU), has discovered that the stealthy more_eggs malware has re-emerged once again this year infecting corporate entities. More_eggs is malicious software containing several components engineered to steal valuable credentials, including usernames and passwords for corporate bank accounts, email accounts and IT administrator accounts, among others.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Between the end of 2018 and April 2021, there have been three distinct more_eggs LinkedIn campaigns using the same Modus Operandi. Each campaign targeted corporate employees, utilized their LinkedIn profile, and then social engineered them with bogus job offers, which lead to the more_eggs malware.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Security Awareness Training for All Employees. Security Awareness training should be mandated for all company employees. The training should ensure that employees:Avoid downloading and executing files from unverified sources.

Malware that abuses LOLBINs bypasses binary detection approaches. Therefore, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents need to be installed on all hosts. An EDR solution is a necessary technology for detecting threats such as more_eggs ,and EDR agents must be continuously monitored and updated with the evolving threat landscape. If not, then critical alerts will not be triaged and investigated. Managed Detection and Response (MDR) providers offer this service. Robust and comprehensive MDR services require an AI-powered Extended Detection and Response (XDR) technology platform so that the hundreds of daily security signals, generated by an organizations EDR agents, can be promptly ingested, analyzed and responded to. Security events which can be resolved through an automated response are processed, while security events requiring a hands-on response are handled by the MDRs cybersecurity analysts and threat hunters.<br/>Monitor the Threat Landscape. Organizations need relevant threat intelligence, and it must be actioned in a timely fashion. Additionally, ones security team needs to be specifically informed about an organizations operating environment, working in concert with ones security provider.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The social engineering method for this current more_eggs campaign consisted of disguising a zipped copy of the VenomLNK malware as a job applicants resume. A benign PDF resume is included as well, which serves as a decoy resume, while more_eggs installs TerraLoader.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>We tend to see threat campaigns, involving the sophisticated and versatile more_eggs malware, just a few times a year compared to some other threats. In addition to the spearphishing component, this indicates to me that threat actors, using the more_eggs service, are selective and patient.</li>

                                        <li>More_eggs is a sophisticated suite of malware components. One of those components is VenomLink (a component used to trick the victim into installing TerraLoader). TerraLoader is an intermediate component used to install numerous modules designed to take malicious actions such as credential theft, lateral movement, and file encryption throughout a victims IT network. A complete analysis of the 2020 version of more_eggs was conducted by Quo Intelligence, who broke the malware into several modules. Here is a full breakdown:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>eSentire's Threat Response Unit (TRU) research team has discovered a new threat campaign using the more_eggs malware.<br/>More_eggs is a stealthy, lethal malware that contains components engineered to steal usernames and passwords for corporate bank accounts, email accounts and IT administrator accounts, among others.<br/>The current more_eggs campaign involves hackers posing as job applicants and luring Corporate Hiring Managers into downloading what they believe are resumes from job applicants. In actuality, the resumes contain the more_eggs malware.<br/>TRU has detected and shut down four different more_eggs security incidents recently. Three of them occurred at the end of March, and they all involve the new variant of more_eggs. The organizations attacked include a U.S.-based aerospace/defense company that designs, develops and provides maintenance repair for airline components; a large UK-based CPA firm; an international business law firm based out of Canada; and a national Canadian staffing agency.<br/>One year ago, TRU also discovered a spearphishing campaign infecting victims with more_eggs. However, during that operation, the threat actors were targeting professionals on LinkedIn who were looking for jobs, as opposed to Hiring Managers looking for job candidates. The hackers sent the job seekers .zip files disguised as job offers. When the targets opened the zip file, it led to the installation of more_eggs.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>That activity mirrors a threat campaign that was reported separately in February 2019 by ProofPoint researchers. In these incidents, threat actors were observed attacking retail, entertainment and pharmaceutical companies online payments systems and using malicious documents, laden with more_eggs, to target the companies employees. The threat actors sent fake job offers to the employees, cleverly using the job title listed on their LinkedIn profiles, in their communications. The campaigns reported in February 2019 by Visa and ProofPoint could be the same operation or, they could be two separate campaigns. However, what we do know is that the targets (eCommerce companies payment systems) and tools (more_eggs) were used in both scams.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Ironically, around the same time last year in April 2021, TRU discovered a spearphishing campaign which was infecting victims with more_eggs. However, during that campaign, rather than posing as hopeful job candidates sending a poisoned resume, the threat actors targeted professionals on LinkedIn who were looking for jobs. The hackers sent the job seekers .zip files disguised as job offers. When the targets opened the zip file, it led to the installation of more_eggs. The threat actors behind the campaign tried enticing the targets into clicking on the zip file by naming the file after the job seekers current job title and adding position at the end.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>VenomLNK is a poisoned LNK file. Windows uses LNK files to automate program execution. More_eggs uses a maliciously-written LNK file to execute TerraLoader by tricking the user into opening what they think is a document.<br/>TerraLoader loads the other modules from VenomLNK.<br/>TerraPreter provides a Meterpreter (a Metasploit attack payload) shell in memory.<br/>TerraStealer is an info stealing module used to exfiltrate sensitive data.<br/>TerraTV allows threat actors to hijack TeamViewer for lateral movement.<br/>TerraCrypt is a ransomware plugin for PureLocker ransomware, aka CR1 Ransomware, a lesser-known ransomware.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The current threat campaign utilizes several similar features TRU observed in the 2021 more_eggs LinkedIn operation including: the VenomLNK module, including a decoy document, and .lnk file, and multi-phase execution through writing and reading .txt files (which turned out to be .xml files with JavaScript contents upon inspection). The TerraLoader equivalent, however, abuses ie4uinit.exe instead of cmstsp.exe, eventually leading to the abuse of msxsl.exe as we reported in April 2021.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Interestingly, intelligence analysts with Visa reported in February2019 that at the end of 2018, FIN6 was specifically targeting numerous e-Commerce companies payment servers and using malicious documents to infect their targets with more_eggs as the initial phase of their attack.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>As stated earlier, rather than targeting hopeful candidates looking for work, the hackers are targeting businesses looking for employees.<br/>In place of the previously abused Windows process, cmstp.exe which manages network connections more_eggs is abusing ie4uinit.exe, another Windows Process, to load its malicious plugins.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>This year the more_eggs operation has flipped the social engineering script, targeting hiring managers with fake resumes instead of targeting jobseekers with fake job offers.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>More_eggs is a stealthy, lethal malware that has several components engineered to steal valuable credentials, such as usernames and passwords for corporate bank accounts, email accounts and IT administrator accounts, among others. Once accessed, the hackers exfiltrate data from the victim organization, spread to other computer hosts via TeamViewer, and encrypt files. The Golden Chickens group (aka Venom Spider) is believed to be the threat operators behind more_eggs. Interestingly, several top financial cybercrime groups, including the infamous FIN6 gang, Evilnum and the Cobalt Group have employed the more_eggs malware in their attack campaigns.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The threat actors behind more_eggs use a scalable, spearphishing approach that weaponizes expected communications, such as resumes, that match a hiring managers expectations or job offers, targeting hopeful candidates, that match their current or past job titles.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Golden Chickens also known as Venom Spider, Golden Chickens has been operating the more_eggs malware-as-a-service since at least 2018.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>More_Eggs Came Calling for Easter</li>
                                    
                                        <li>TRU has uncovered a more_eggs phishing campaign where hackers are posing as job applicants and luring Corporate Hiring Managers into downloading what they believe are resumes from job applicants. However, the bogus resumes contain the more_eggs malware.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Thus far, TRU has discovered and shut down four separate security incidents relating to the current more_eggs campaign. Three of them occurred at the end of March, and the organizations attacked include a U.S.-based aerospace/defense company; a large UK-based CPA firm; an international business law firm based out of Canada; and a national Canadian staffing agency. TRU has produced a full report outlining their findings and how best to protect against the current more_eggs threat.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>As with previous more_eggs variants observed by TRU, the malware abuses legitimate Windows processes to evade detection, alongside a decoy document to trick users. With the incident involving the accounting firm, an employee of the firm received what they thought was a candidates resume, when in actuality the resume was the VenomLNK malware. Once VenomLNK was executed, it proceeded to execute TerraLoader so that TerraLoader could then load various information stealing and intrusion modules of the more_eggs malware suite. With this campaign however, there are two notable differences:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Evilnum - The Evilnum cybercrime group is best known for compromising financial technology companies, which are companies that provide stock trading platforms and tools. Their target is financial information about the targeted FINTECH companies and their customers. They target items such as spreadsheets and documents with customer lists, investments and trading operations and credentials for trading software/platforms and software.The Evilnum group is also known to spearphish employees of the companies they are targeting and enclose malicious zip files. If executed, the employees get hit with the more_eggs backdoor, along with other malware.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>More_eggs a malware suite that includes a social engineering initial access vector (VenomLNK), a plugin loader (TerraLoader) that loads modules, and functional modules that are capable of infostealing (TerraStealers) meterpreter shells (TerraPreter), and evasive lateral movement (TerraTV). See The Interworkings of More_Eggs section for more.</li>

                                        <li>More_eggs is a stealthy, lethal malware that has several components engineered to steal valuable credentials, such as usernames and passwords for corporate bank accounts, email accounts and IT administrator accounts, among others. Once accessed, the hackers exfiltrate data from the victim organization, spread to other computer hosts via TeamViewer, and encrypt files. The Golden Chickens group (aka Venom Spider) is believed to be the threat operators behind more_eggs. Interestingly, several top financial cybercrime groups, including the infamous FIN6 gang, Evilnum and the Cobalt Group have employed the more_eggs malware in their attack campaigns.</li>

Once accessed, the hackers exfiltrate data from the victim organization, spread to other computer hosts via TeamViewer, and encrypt files. The Golden Chickens group (aka Venom Spider) is believed to be the threat operators behind more_eggs. Interestingly, several top financial cybercrime groups, including the infamous FIN6 gang, Evilnum and the Cobalt Group have employed the more_eggs malware in their attack campaigns.</li>

                                        <li>Interestingly, intelligence analysts with Visa reported in February2019 that at the end of 2018, FIN6 was specifically targeting numerous e-Commerce companies payment servers and using malicious documents to infect their targets with more_eggs as the initial phase of their attack.</li>

What we do know is that this current activity demonstrates a role-reversal from last years more_eggs LinkedIn campaign. We also know that the more_eggs Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) is known to be utilized by the very capable FIN6, Evilnum<br/>and Cobalt<br/>cybercriminals.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>More_eggs is a stealthy, lethal malware that has several components engineered to steal valuable credentials, such as usernames and passwords for corporate bank accounts, email accounts and IT administrator accounts, among others. Once accessed, the hackers exfiltrate data from the victim organization, spread to other computer hosts via TeamViewer, and encrypt files. The Golden Chickens group (aka Venom Spider) is believed to be the threat operators behind more_eggs. Interestingly, several top financial cybercrime groups, including the infamous FIN6 gang, Evilnum and the Cobalt Group have employed the more_eggs malware in their attack campaigns.</li>

                                        <li>FIN6 - FIN6 is a financial cybercrime group that primarily steals payment card data and sells it on underground marketplaces. The FIN6 group first gained notoriety in 2014 for their attacks against point-of-sale (POS) machines in retail outlets and hospitality companies. Continuing their quest for credit and debit card data, they later moved on to targeting e-Commerce companies and stole their credit card data via online skimming. The FIN6 threat group has also been known to infect some of their victims with ransomware.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Later in August 2019, the FIN6 operators launched another malicious campaign, and researchers believe with this operation FIN6 was actively going after multinational organizations. Similar to the February 2019 campaign launched against the retail, entertainment, and pharmaceutical companies; employees were spearphished with fake job offers. According to security researchers, to gain access to victim environments, the threat actor began by targeting handpicked employees using LinkedIn messaging and email, advertising fake jobs to lure recipients into checking into the supposed offers.</li>

                                        <li>Since these more_eggs attacks were disrupted, the TRU team cannot know with certainty what the end game is for this operation or what threat group is behind these attacks. What we do know is that this current activity demonstrates a role-reversal from last years more_eggs LinkedIn campaign. We also know that the more_eggs Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) is known to be utilized by the very capable FIN6, Evilnum<br/>and Cobalt<br/>cybercriminals.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>More_eggs is a stealthy, lethal malware that has several components engineered to steal valuable credentials, such as usernames and passwords for corporate bank accounts, email accounts and IT administrator accounts, among others. Once accessed, the hackers exfiltrate data from the victim organization, spread to other computer hosts via TeamViewer, and encrypt files. The Golden Chickens group (aka Venom Spider) is believed to be the threat operators behind more_eggs. Interestingly, several top financial cybercrime groups, including the infamous FIN6 gang, Evilnum and the Cobalt Group have employed the more_eggs malware in their attack campaigns.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Evilnum - The Evilnum cybercrime group is best known for compromising financial technology companies, which are companies that provide stock trading platforms and tools. Their target is financial information about the targeted FINTECH companies and their customers. They target items such as spreadsheets and documents with customer lists, investments and trading operations and credentials for trading software/platforms and software.The Evilnum group is also known to spearphish employees of the companies they are targeting and enclose malicious zip files. If executed, the employees get hit with the more_eggs backdoor, along with other malware.</li>

                                        <li>The current threat campaign utilizes several similar features TRU observed in the 2021 more_eggs LinkedIn operation including: the VenomLNK module, including a decoy document, and .lnk file, and multi-phase execution through writing and reading .txt files (which turned out to be .xml files with JavaScript contents upon inspection). The TerraLoader equivalent, however, abuses ie4uinit.exe instead of cmstsp.exe, eventually leading to the abuse of msxsl.exe as we reported in April 2021.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The social engineering method for this current more_eggs campaign consisted of disguising a zipped copy of the VenomLNK malware as a job applicants resume. A benign PDF resume is included as well, which serves as a decoy resume, while more_eggs installs TerraLoader.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>As with previous more_eggs variants observed by TRU, the malware abuses legitimate Windows processes to evade detection, alongside a decoy document to trick users. With the incident involving the accounting firm, an employee of the firm received what they thought was a candidates resume, when in actuality the resume was the VenomLNK malware. Once VenomLNK was executed, it proceeded to execute TerraLoader so that TerraLoader could then load various information stealing and intrusion modules of the more_eggs malware suite. With this campaign however, there are two notable differences:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>More_eggs is a sophisticated suite of malware components. One of those components is VenomLink (a component used to trick the victim into installing TerraLoader). TerraLoader is an intermediate component used to install numerous modules designed to take malicious actions such as credential theft, lateral movement, and file encryption throughout a victims IT network. A complete analysis of the 2020 version of more_eggs was conducted by Quo Intelligence, who broke the malware into several modules. Here is a full breakdown:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>More_eggs a malware suite that includes a social engineering initial access vector (VenomLNK), a plugin loader (TerraLoader) that loads modules, and functional modules that are capable of infostealing (TerraStealers) meterpreter shells (TerraPreter), and evasive lateral movement (TerraTV). See The Interworkings of More_Eggs section for more.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>VenomLNK is a poisoned LNK file. Windows uses LNK files to automate program execution. More_eggs uses a maliciously-written LNK file to execute TerraLoader by tricking the user into opening what they think is a document.<br/>TerraLoader loads the other modules from VenomLNK.<br/>TerraPreter provides a Meterpreter (a Metasploit attack payload) shell in memory.<br/>TerraStealer is an info stealing module used to exfiltrate sensitive data.<br/>TerraTV allows threat actors to hijack TeamViewer for lateral movement.<br/>TerraCrypt is a ransomware plugin for PureLocker ransomware, aka CR1 Ransomware, a lesser-known ransomware.</li>

Malware that abuses LOLBINs bypasses binary detection approaches. Therefore, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents need to be installed on all hosts. An EDR solution is a necessary technology for detecting threats such as more_eggs ,and EDR agents must be continuously monitored and updated with the evolving threat landscape. If not, then critical alerts will not be triaged and investigated. Managed Detection and Response (MDR) providers offer this service. Robust and comprehensive MDR services require an AI-powered Extended Detection and Response (XDR) technology platform so that the hundreds of daily security signals, generated by an organizations EDR agents, can be promptly ingested, analyzed and responded to. Security events which can be resolved through an automated response are processed, while security events requiring a hands-on response are handled by the MDRs cybersecurity analysts and threat hunters.<br/>Monitor the Threat Landscape. Organizations need relevant threat intelligence, and it must be actioned in a timely fashion. Additionally, ones security team needs to be specifically informed about an organizations operating environment, working in concert with ones security provider.</li>

                                        <li>Of course, for a threat group to get a foothold into the IT environments of an aerospace/ defense company, an international law firm, an international CPA firm and a national corporate staffing agency could be very lucrative. Successfully infecting a corporate employee with the more_eggs malware could potentially enable a threat actor(s) to commit a variety of cybercrimes including deploying ransomware, stealing intellectual property, stealing credentials to corporate bank accounts, or committing business email compromise, among others.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>A more_eggs malware campaign has appeared, just as it did last year during the Easter season. eSentires Threat Response Unit (TRU) security research team has discovered a phishing campaign where hackers are posing as job applicants and luring Corporate Hiring Managers into downloading what they believe are resumes from job applicants. However, the bogus resumes contain the more_eggs malware.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Since these more_eggs attacks were disrupted, the TRU team cannot know with certainty what the end game is for this operation or what threat group is behind these attacks. What we do know is that this current activity demonstrates a role-reversal from last years more_eggs LinkedIn campaign. We also know that the more_eggs Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) is known to be utilized by the very capable FIN6, Evilnum<br/>and Cobalt<br/>cybercriminals.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Anti-Virus(AV) is not enough to protect employees and home users from cyber threats. Because malware like more_eggs takes the so-called fileless approach to evade AV, there is no malicious executable for AV to detect. Rather, more_eggs achieves execution by passing malicious code to legitimate windows processes and letting those windows processes do the work for them.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>For example, if the LinkedIn members job is listed as Senior Account ExecutiveInternational Freight, the malicious zip file would be titled Senior Account Executive International Freight position. Upon opening the fake job offer, the victim unwittingly initiated the installation of more_eggs.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>eSentires<br/>security research team, the Threat Response Unit (TRU), has discovered that the stealthy more_eggs malware has re-emerged once again this year infecting corporate entities. More_eggs is malicious software containing several components engineered to steal valuable credentials, including usernames and passwords for corporate bank accounts, email accounts and IT administrator accounts, among others.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Between the end of 2018 and April 2021, there have been three distinct more_eggs LinkedIn campaigns using the same Modus Operandi. Each campaign targeted corporate employees, utilized their LinkedIn profile, and then social engineered them with bogus job offers, which lead to the more_eggs malware.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Security Awareness Training for All Employees. Security Awareness training should be mandated for all company employees. The training should ensure that employees:Avoid downloading and executing files from unverified sources. For example, be wary of Word and Excel documents sent from an unknown source or acquired from the Internet that prompts you to Enable Macros.Avoid free versions of paid software.Always inspect the full URL before downloading files to ensure it matches the source (e.g., Microsoft Team should come from a Microsoft domain).Inspect file extensions.

Malware that abuses LOLBINs bypasses binary detection approaches. Therefore, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents need to be installed on all hosts. An EDR solution is a necessary technology for detecting threats such as more_eggs ,and EDR agents must be continuously monitored and updated with the evolving threat landscape. If not, then critical alerts will not be triaged and investigated. Managed Detection and Response (MDR) providers offer this service. Robust and comprehensive MDR services require an AI-powered Extended Detection and Response (XDR) technology platform so that the hundreds of daily security signals, generated by an organizations EDR agents, can be promptly ingested, analyzed and responded to. Security events which can be resolved through an automated response are processed, while security events requiring a hands-on response are handled by the MDRs cybersecurity analysts and threat hunters.<br/>Monitor the Threat Landscape. Organizations need relevant threat intelligence, and it must be actioned in a timely fashion. Additionally, ones security team needs to be specifically informed about an organizations operating environment, working in concert with ones security provider.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The social engineering method for this current more_eggs campaign consisted of disguising a zipped copy of the VenomLNK malware as a job applicants resume. A benign PDF resume is included as well, which serves as a decoy resume, while more_eggs installs TerraLoader.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>We tend to see threat campaigns, involving the sophisticated and versatile more_eggs malware, just a few times a year compared to some other threats. In addition to the spearphishing component, this indicates to me that threat actors, using the more_eggs service, are selective and patient.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>LOLBINS stands for Living-Off-The-Land-Binaries and represents a class of Windows processes that can be abused in malware, such as more_eggs.</li>

One of those components is VenomLink (a component used to trick the victim into installing TerraLoader). TerraLoader is an intermediate component used to install numerous modules designed to take malicious actions such as credential theft, lateral movement, and file encryption throughout a victims IT network. A complete analysis of the 2020 version of more_eggs was conducted by Quo Intelligence, who broke the malware into several modules. Here is a full breakdown:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>eSentire's Threat Response Unit (TRU) research team has discovered a new threat campaign using the more_eggs malware.<br/>More_eggs is a stealthy, lethal malware that contains components engineered to steal usernames and passwords for corporate bank accounts, email accounts and IT administrator accounts, among others.<br/>The current more_eggs campaign involves hackers posing as job applicants and luring Corporate Hiring Managers into downloading what they believe are resumes from job applicants. In actuality, the resumes contain the more_eggs malware.<br/>TRU has detected and shut down four different more_eggs security incidents recently. Three of them occurred at the end of March, and they all involve the new variant of more_eggs. The organizations attacked include a U.S.-based aerospace/defense company that designs, develops and provides maintenance repair for airline components; a large UK-based CPA firm; an international business law firm based out of Canada; and a national Canadian staffing agency.<br/>One year ago, TRU also discovered a spearphishing campaign infecting victims with more_eggs. However, during that operation, the threat actors were targeting professionals on LinkedIn who were looking for jobs, as opposed to Hiring Managers looking for job candidates. The hackers sent the job seekers .zip files disguised as job offers. When the targets opened the zip file, it led to the installation of more_eggs.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>That activity mirrors a threat campaign that was reported separately in February 2019 by ProofPoint researchers. In these incidents, threat actors were observed attacking retail, entertainment and pharmaceutical companies online payments systems and using malicious documents, laden with more_eggs, to target the companies employees. The threat actors sent fake job offers to the employees, cleverly using the job title listed on their LinkedIn profiles, in their communications. The campaigns reported in February 2019 by Visa and ProofPoint could be the same operation or, they could be two separate campaigns. However, what we do know is that the targets (eCommerce companies payment systems) and tools (more_eggs) were used in both scams.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>VenomLNK is a poisoned LNK file. Windows uses LNK files to automate program execution. More_eggs uses a maliciously-written LNK file to execute TerraLoader by tricking the user into opening what they think is a document.<br/>TerraLoader loads the other modules from VenomLNK.<br/>TerraPreter provides a Meterpreter (a Metasploit attack payload) shell in memory.<br/>TerraStealer is an info stealing module used to exfiltrate sensitive data.<br/>TerraTV allows threat actors to hijack TeamViewer for lateral movement.<br/>TerraCrypt is a ransomware plugin for PureLocker ransomware, aka CR1 Ransomware, a lesser-known ransomware.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Later in August 2019, the FIN6 operators launched another malicious campaign, and researchers believe with this operation FIN6 was actively going after multinational organizations. Similar to the February 2019 campaign launched against the retail, entertainment, and pharmaceutical companies; employees were spearphished with fake job offers. According to security researchers, to gain access to victim environments, the threat actor began by targeting handpicked employees using LinkedIn messaging and email, advertising fake jobs to lure recipients into checking into the supposed offers.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Interestingly, intelligence analysts with Visa reported in February2019 that at the end of 2018, FIN6 was specifically targeting numerous e-Commerce companies payment servers and using malicious documents to infect their targets with more_eggs as the initial phase of their attack.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>As stated earlier, rather than targeting hopeful candidates looking for work, the hackers are targeting businesses looking for employees.<br/>In place of the previously abused Windows process, cmstp.exe which manages network connections more_eggs is abusing ie4uinit.exe, another Windows Process, to load its malicious plugins.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>More_eggs is a stealthy, lethal malware that has several components engineered to steal valuable credentials, such as usernames and passwords for corporate bank accounts, email accounts and IT administrator accounts, among others. Once accessed, the hackers exfiltrate data from the victim organization, spread to other computer hosts via TeamViewer, and encrypt files. The Golden Chickens group (aka Venom Spider) is believed to be the threat operators behind more_eggs. Interestingly, several top financial cybercrime groups, including the infamous FIN6 gang, Evilnum and the Cobalt Group have employed the more_eggs malware in their attack campaigns.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Golden Chickens also known as Venom Spider, Golden Chickens has been operating the more_eggs malware-as-a-service since at least 2018.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Infostealing infostealing capabilities in malware can be geared towards a variety of information targets such as configuration options (like stealing cookies to simulate the victims web sessions), login credentials saved in browsers and files, and credit card information (saved in browsers).</li>
                                    
                                        <li>TRU has uncovered a more_eggs phishing campaign where hackers are posing as job applicants and luring Corporate Hiring Managers into downloading what they believe are resumes from job applicants. However, the bogus resumes contain the more_eggs malware.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>As with previous more_eggs variants observed by TRU, the malware abuses legitimate Windows processes to evade detection, alongside a decoy document to trick users. With the incident involving the accounting firm, an employee of the firm received what they thought was a candidates resume, when in actuality the resume was the VenomLNK malware. Once VenomLNK was executed, it proceeded to execute TerraLoader so that TerraLoader could then load various information stealing and intrusion modules of the more_eggs malware suite. With this campaign however, there are two notable differences:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Evilnum - The Evilnum cybercrime group is best known for compromising financial technology companies, which are companies that provide stock trading platforms and tools. Their target is financial information about the targeted FINTECH companies and their customers. They target items such as spreadsheets and documents with customer lists, investments and trading operations and credentials for trading software/platforms and software.The Evilnum group is also known to spearphish employees of the companies they are targeting and enclose malicious zip files. If executed, the employees get hit with the more_eggs backdoor, along with other malware.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>More_eggs a malware suite that includes a social engineering initial access vector (VenomLNK), a plugin loader (TerraLoader) that loads modules, and functional modules that are capable of infostealing (TerraStealers) meterpreter shells (TerraPreter), and evasive lateral movement (TerraTV). See The Interworkings of More_Eggs section for more.</li>

                                        <li>Ironically, around the same time last year in April 2021, TRU discovered a spearphishing campaign which was infecting victims with more_eggs. However, during that campaign, rather than posing as hopeful job candidates sending a poisoned resume, the threat actors targeted professionals on LinkedIn who were looking for jobs. The hackers sent the job seekers .zip files disguised as job offers. When the targets opened the zip file, it led to the installation of more_eggs. The threat actors behind the campaign tried enticing the targets into clicking on the zip file by naming the file after the job seekers current job title and adding position at the end.</li>

                                        <li>Interestingly, intelligence analysts with Visa reported in February2019 that at the end of 2018, FIN6 was specifically targeting numerous e-Commerce companies payment servers and using malicious documents to infect their targets with more_eggs as the initial phase of their attack.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Of course, for a threat group to get a foothold into the IT environments of an aerospace/ defense company, an international law firm, an international CPA firm and a national corporate staffing agency could be very lucrative. Successfully infecting a corporate employee with the more_eggs malware could potentially enable a threat actor(s) to commit a variety of cybercrimes including deploying ransomware, stealing intellectual property, stealing credentials to corporate bank accounts, or committing business email compromise, among others.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>eSentire's Threat Response Unit (TRU) research team has discovered a new threat campaign using the more_eggs malware.<br/>More_eggs is a stealthy, lethal malware that contains components engineered to steal usernames and passwords for corporate bank accounts, email accounts and IT administrator accounts, among others.<br/>The current more_eggs campaign involves hackers posing as job applicants and luring Corporate Hiring Managers into downloading what they believe are resumes from job applicants. In actuality, the resumes contain the more_eggs malware.<br/>TRU has detected and shut down four different more_eggs security incidents recently. Three of them occurred at the end of March, and they all involve the new variant of more_eggs. The organizations attacked include a U.S.-based aerospace/defense company that designs, develops and provides maintenance repair for airline components; a large UK-based CPA firm; an international business law firm based out of Canada; and a national Canadian staffing agency.<br/>One year ago, TRU also discovered a spearphishing campaign infecting victims with more_eggs. However, during that operation, the threat actors were targeting professionals on LinkedIn who were looking for jobs, as opposed to Hiring Managers looking for job candidates. The hackers sent the job seekers .zip files disguised as job offers. When the targets opened the zip file, it led to the installation of more_eggs.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Cobalt Group - The Cobalt Group is also known to go after financial companies, and it has repeatedly used the more_eggs backdoor in their attacks.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>More_eggs is a stealthy, lethal malware that has several components engineered to steal valuable credentials, such as usernames and passwords for corporate bank accounts, email accounts and IT administrator accounts, among others. Once accessed, the hackers exfiltrate data from the victim organization, spread to other computer hosts via TeamViewer, and encrypt files. The Golden Chickens group (aka Venom Spider) is believed to be the threat operators behind more_eggs. Interestingly, several top financial cybercrime groups, including the infamous FIN6 gang, Evilnum and the Cobalt Group have employed the more_eggs malware in their attack campaigns.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Evilnum - The Evilnum cybercrime group is best known for compromising financial technology companies, which are companies that provide stock trading platforms and tools. Their target is financial information about the targeted FINTECH companies and their customers. They target items such as spreadsheets and documents with customer lists, investments and trading operations and credentials for trading software/platforms and software.The Evilnum group is also known to spearphish employees of the companies they are targeting and enclose malicious zip files. If executed, the employees get hit with the more_eggs backdoor, along with other malware.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>That activity mirrors a threat campaign that was reported separately in February 2019 by ProofPoint researchers. In these incidents, threat actors were observed attacking retail, entertainment and pharmaceutical companies online payments systems and using malicious documents, laden with more_eggs, to target the companies employees. The threat actors sent fake job offers to the employees, cleverly using the job title listed on their LinkedIn profiles, in their communications. The campaigns reported in February 2019 by Visa and ProofPoint could be the same operation or, they could be two separate campaigns. However, what we do know is that the targets (eCommerce companies payment systems) and tools (more_eggs) were used in both scams.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>FIN6 - FIN6 is a financial cybercrime group that primarily steals payment card data and sells it on underground marketplaces. The FIN6 group first gained notoriety in 2014 for their attacks against point-of-sale (POS) machines in retail outlets and hospitality companies. Continuing their quest for credit and debit card data, they later moved on to targeting e-Commerce companies and stole their credit card data via online skimming. The FIN6 threat group has also been known to infect some of their victims with ransomware.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>eSentires<br/>security research team, the Threat Response Unit (TRU), has discovered that the stealthy more_eggs malware has re-emerged once again this year infecting corporate entities. More_eggs is malicious software containing several components engineered to steal valuable credentials, including usernames and passwords for corporate bank accounts, email accounts and IT administrator accounts, among others.</li>

                                        <li>Of course, for a threat group to get a foothold into the IT environments of an aerospace/ defense company, an international law firm, an international CPA firm and a national corporate staffing agency could be very lucrative. Successfully infecting a corporate employee with the more_eggs malware could potentially enable a threat actor(s) to commit a variety of cybercrimes including deploying ransomware, stealing intellectual property, stealing credentials to corporate bank accounts, or committing business email compromise, among others.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The threat actors behind the current more_ eggs campaign dont appear to be randomly targeting companies. For example, the CPA firm and the staffing agency, both list a job posting on Indeed.com and LinkedIn which match the title of the resume each hiring manager received. The aerospace/defense company also had a job listed on zip Recruiter.com which matches the title of the fake resume received.</li>

Three of them occurred at the end of March, and the organizations attacked include a U.S.-based aerospace/defense company; a large UK-based CPA firm; an international business law firm based out of Canada; and a national Canadian staffing agency. TRU has produced a full report outlining their findings and how best to protect against the current more_eggs threat.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>eSentire's Threat Response Unit (TRU) research team has discovered a new threat campaign using the more_eggs malware.<br/>More_eggs is a stealthy, lethal malware that contains components engineered to steal usernames and passwords for corporate bank accounts, email accounts and IT administrator accounts, among others.<br/>The current more_eggs campaign involves hackers posing as job applicants and luring Corporate Hiring Managers into downloading what they believe are resumes from job applicants. In actuality, the resumes contain the more_eggs malware.<br/>TRU has detected and shut down four different more_eggs security incidents recently. Three of them occurred at the end of March, and they all involve the new variant of more_eggs. The organizations attacked include a U.S.-based aerospace/defense company that designs, develops and provides maintenance repair for airline components; a large UK-based CPA firm; an international business law firm based out of Canada; and a national Canadian staffing agency.<br/>One year ago, TRU also discovered a spearphishing campaign infecting victims with more_eggs. However, during that operation, the threat actors were targeting professionals on LinkedIn who were looking for jobs, as opposed to Hiring Managers looking for job candidates. The hackers sent the job seekers .zip files disguised as job offers. When the targets opened the zip file, it led to the installation of more_eggs.</li>

                                        <li>That activity mirrors a threat campaign that was reported separately in February 2019 by ProofPoint researchers. In these incidents, threat actors were observed attacking retail, entertainment and pharmaceutical companies online payments systems and using malicious documents, laden with more_eggs, to target the companies employees. The threat actors sent fake job offers to the employees, cleverly using the job title listed on their LinkedIn profiles, in their communications. The campaigns reported in February 2019 by Visa and ProofPoint could be the same operation or, they could be two separate campaigns. However, what we do know is that the targets (eCommerce companies payment systems) and tools (more_eggs) were used in both scams.</li>

The FIN6 group first gained notoriety in 2014 for their attacks against point-of-sale (POS) machines in retail outlets and hospitality companies. Continuing their quest for credit and debit card data, they later moved on to targeting e-Commerce companies and stole their credit card data via online skimming. The FIN6 threat group has also been known to infect some of their victims with ransomware.</li>

                                        <li>eSentire's Threat Response Unit (TRU) research team has discovered a new threat campaign using the more_eggs malware.<br/>More_eggs is a stealthy, lethal malware that contains components engineered to steal usernames and passwords for corporate bank accounts, email accounts and IT administrator accounts, among others.<br/>The current more_eggs campaign involves hackers posing as job applicants and luring Corporate Hiring Managers into downloading what they believe are resumes from job applicants. In actuality, the resumes contain the more_eggs malware.<br/>TRU has detected and shut down four different more_eggs security incidents recently. Three of them occurred at the end of March, and they all involve the new variant of more_eggs. The organizations attacked include a U.S.-based aerospace/defense company that designs, develops and provides maintenance repair for airline components; a large UK-based CPA firm; an international business law firm based out of Canada; and a national Canadian staffing agency.<br/>One year ago, TRU also discovered a spearphishing campaign infecting victims with more_eggs. However, during that operation, the threat actors were targeting professionals on LinkedIn who were looking for jobs, as opposed to Hiring Managers looking for job candidates. The hackers sent the job seekers .zip files disguised as job offers. When the targets opened the zip file, it led to the installation of more_eggs.</li>

Three of them occurred at the end of March, and the organizations attacked include a U.S.-based aerospace/defense company; a large UK-based CPA firm; an international business law firm based out of Canada; and a national Canadian staffing agency. TRU has produced a full report outlining their findings and how best to protect against the current more_eggs threat.</li>

                                        <li>The threat actors behind the current more_ eggs campaign dont appear to be randomly targeting companies. For example, the CPA firm and the staffing agency, both list a job posting on Indeed.com and LinkedIn which match the title of the resume each hiring manager received. The aerospace/defense company also had a job listed on zip Recruiter.com which matches the title of the fake resume received.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>This year the more_eggs operation has flipped the social engineering script, targeting hiring managers with fake resumes instead of targeting jobseekers with fake job offers.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>TRU has uncovered a more_eggs phishing campaign where hackers are posing as job applicants and luring Corporate Hiring Managers into downloading what they believe are resumes from job applicants.

                                        <li>eSentire's Threat Response Unit (TRU) research team has discovered a new threat campaign using the more_eggs malware.<br/>More_eggs is a stealthy, lethal malware that contains components engineered to steal usernames and passwords for corporate bank accounts, email accounts and IT administrator accounts, among others.<br/>The current more_eggs campaign involves hackers posing as job applicants and luring Corporate Hiring Managers into downloading what they believe are resumes from job applicants. In actuality, the resumes contain the more_eggs malware.<br/>TRU has detected and shut down four different more_eggs security incidents recently. Three of them occurred at the end of March, and they all involve the new variant of more_eggs. The organizations attacked include a U.S.-based aerospace/defense company that designs, develops and provides maintenance repair for airline components; a large UK-based CPA firm; an international business law firm based out of Canada; and a national Canadian staffing agency.<br/>One year ago, TRU also discovered a spearphishing campaign infecting victims with more_eggs. However, during that operation, the threat actors were targeting professionals on LinkedIn who were looking for jobs, as opposed to Hiring Managers looking for job candidates. The hackers sent the job seekers .zip files disguised as job offers. When the targets opened the zip file, it led to the installation of more_eggs.</li>

                                        <li>eSentire's Threat Response Unit (TRU) research team has discovered a new threat campaign using the more_eggs malware.<br/>More_eggs is a stealthy, lethal malware that contains components engineered to steal usernames and passwords for corporate bank accounts, email accounts and IT administrator accounts, among others.<br/>The current more_eggs campaign involves hackers posing as job applicants and luring Corporate Hiring Managers into downloading what they believe are resumes from job applicants. In actuality, the resumes contain the more_eggs malware.<br/>TRU has detected and shut down four different more_eggs security incidents recently. Three of them occurred at the end of March, and they all involve the new variant of more_eggs. The organizations attacked include a U.S.-based aerospace/defense company that designs, develops and provides maintenance repair for airline components; a large UK-based CPA firm; an international business law firm based out of Canada; and a national Canadian staffing agency.<br/>One year ago, TRU also discovered a spearphishing campaign infecting victims with more_eggs. However, during that operation, the threat actors were targeting professionals on LinkedIn who were looking for jobs, as opposed to Hiring Managers looking for job candidates. The hackers sent the job seekers .zip files disguised as job offers. When the targets opened the zip file, it led to the installation of more_eggs.</li>

                                        <li>Thus far, in the current more_eggs campaign, the eSentire TRU team has discovered and shut down four separate security incidents. Three of them occurred at the end of March, and they all involve the new variant of more_eggs. The organizations attacked include a U.S.-based aerospace/defense company that designs, develops and provides maintenance repair for airline components; a large UK-based CPA firm; an international business law firm based out of Canada; and a national Canadian staffing agency.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The current threat campaign utilizes several similar features TRU observed in the 2021 more_eggs LinkedIn operation including: the VenomLNK module, including a decoy document, and .lnk file, and multi-phase execution through writing and reading .txt files (which turned out to be .xml files with JavaScript contents upon inspection). The TerraLoader equivalent, however, abuses ie4uinit.exe instead of cmstsp.exe, eventually leading to the abuse of msxsl.exe as we reported in April 2021.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>A more_eggs malware campaign has appeared, just as it did last year during the Easter season. eSentires Threat Response Unit (TRU) security research team has discovered a phishing campaign where hackers are posing as job applicants and luring Corporate Hiring Managers into downloading what they believe are resumes from job applicants. However, the bogus resumes contain the more_eggs malware.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Since these more_eggs attacks were disrupted, the TRU team cannot know with certainty what the end game is for this operation or what threat group is behind these attacks. What we do know is that this current activity demonstrates a role-reversal from last years more_eggs LinkedIn campaign. We also know that the more_eggs Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) is known to be utilized by the very capable FIN6, Evilnum<br/>and Cobalt<br/>cybercriminals.</li>

Three of them occurred at the end of March, and the organizations attacked include a U.S.-based aerospace/defense company; a large UK-based CPA firm; an international business law firm based out of Canada; and a national Canadian staffing agency.

                                        <li>As with previous more_eggs variants observed by TRU, the malware abuses legitimate Windows processes to evade detection, alongside a decoy document to trick users. With the incident involving the accounting firm, an employee of the firm received what they thought was a candidates resume, when in actuality the resume was the VenomLNK malware. Once VenomLNK was executed, it proceeded to execute TerraLoader so that TerraLoader could then load various information stealing and intrusion modules of the more_eggs malware suite. With this campaign however, there are two notable differences:</li>

However, during that operation, the threat actors were targeting professionals on LinkedIn who were looking for jobs, as opposed to Hiring Managers looking for job candidates.

                                        <li>Ironically, around the same time last year in April 2021, TRU discovered a spearphishing campaign which was infecting victims with more_eggs. However, during that campaign, rather than posing as hopeful job candidates sending a poisoned resume, the threat actors targeted professionals on LinkedIn who were looking for jobs. The hackers sent the job seekers .zip files disguised as job offers. When the targets opened the zip file, it led to the installation of more_eggs. The threat actors behind the campaign tried enticing the targets into clicking on the zip file by naming the file after the job seekers current job title and adding position at the end.</li>

In actuality, the resumes contain the more_eggs malware.<br/>TRU has detected and shut down four different more_eggs security incidents recently. Three of them occurred at the end of March, and they all involve the new variant of more_eggs. The organizations attacked include a U.S.-based aerospace/defense company that designs, develops and provides maintenance repair for airline components; a large UK-based CPA firm; an international business law firm based out of Canada; and a national Canadian staffing agency.<br/>One year ago, TRU also discovered a spearphishing campaign infecting victims with more_eggs. However, during that operation, the threat actors were targeting professionals on LinkedIn who were looking for jobs, as opposed to Hiring Managers looking for job candidates. The hackers sent the job seekers .zip files disguised as job offers. When the targets opened the zip file, it led to the installation of more_eggs.</li>

                                        <li>Of course, for a threat group to get a foothold into the IT environments of an aerospace/ defense company, an international law firm, an international CPA firm and a national corporate staffing agency could be very lucrative. Successfully infecting a corporate employee with the more_eggs malware could potentially enable a threat actor(s) to commit a variety of cybercrimes including deploying ransomware, stealing intellectual property, stealing credentials to corporate bank accounts, or committing business email compromise, among others.</li>

The aerospace/defense company also had a job listed on zip Recruiter.com which matches the title of the fake resume received.</li>

                                        <li>eSentire's Threat Response Unit (TRU) research team has discovered a new threat campaign using the more_eggs malware.<br/>More_eggs is a stealthy, lethal malware that contains components engineered to steal usernames and passwords for corporate bank accounts, email accounts and IT administrator accounts, among others.<br/>The current more_eggs campaign involves hackers posing as job applicants and luring Corporate Hiring Managers into downloading what they believe are resumes from job applicants. In actuality, the resumes contain the more_eggs malware.<br/>TRU has detected and shut down four different more_eggs security incidents recently. Three of them occurred at the end of March, and they all involve the new variant of more_eggs. The organizations attacked include a U.S.-based aerospace/defense company that designs, develops and provides maintenance repair for airline components; a large UK-based CPA firm; an international business law firm based out of Canada; and a national Canadian staffing agency.<br/>One year ago, TRU also discovered a spearphishing campaign infecting victims with more_eggs. However, during that operation, the threat actors were targeting professionals on LinkedIn who were looking for jobs, as opposed to Hiring Managers looking for job candidates. The hackers sent the job seekers .zip files disguised as job offers. When the targets opened the zip file, it led to the installation of more_eggs.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Ironically, around the same time last year in April 2021, TRU discovered a spearphishing campaign which was infecting victims with more_eggs. However, during that campaign, rather than posing as hopeful job candidates sending a poisoned resume, the threat actors targeted professionals on LinkedIn who were looking for jobs. The hackers sent the job seekers .zip files disguised as job offers. When the targets opened the zip file, it led to the installation of more_eggs. The threat actors behind the campaign tried enticing the targets into clicking on the zip file by naming the file after the job seekers current job title and adding position at the end.</li>

Once accessed, the hackers exfiltrate data from the victim organization, spread to other computer hosts via TeamViewer, and encrypt files. The Golden Chickens group (aka Venom Spider) is believed to be the threat operators behind more_eggs. Interestingly, several top financial cybercrime groups, including the infamous FIN6 gang, Evilnum and the Cobalt Group have employed the more_eggs malware in their attack campaigns.</li>

                                        <li>FIN6 - FIN6 is a financial cybercrime group that primarily steals payment card data and sells it on underground marketplaces. The FIN6 group first gained notoriety in 2014 for their attacks against point-of-sale (POS) machines in retail outlets and hospitality companies. Continuing their quest for credit and debit card data, they later moved on to targeting e-Commerce companies and stole their credit card data via online skimming. The FIN6 threat group has also been known to infect some of their victims with ransomware.</li>

With the incident involving the accounting firm, an employee of the firm received what they thought was a candidates resume, when in actuality the resume was the VenomLNK malware. Once VenomLNK was executed, it proceeded to execute TerraLoader so that TerraLoader could then load various information stealing and intrusion modules of the more_eggs malware suite. With this campaign however, there are two notable differences:</li>

One of those components is VenomLink (a component used to trick the victim into installing TerraLoader). TerraLoader is an intermediate component used to install numerous modules designed to take malicious actions such as credential theft, lateral movement, and file encryption throughout a victims IT network. A complete analysis of the 2020 version of more_eggs was conducted by Quo Intelligence, who broke the malware into several modules. Here is a full breakdown:</li>

                                        <li>The current threat campaign utilizes several similar features TRU observed in the 2021 more_eggs LinkedIn operation including: the VenomLNK module, including a decoy document, and .lnk file, and multi-phase execution through writing and reading .txt files (which turned out to be .xml files with JavaScript contents upon inspection). The TerraLoader equivalent, however, abuses ie4uinit.exe instead of cmstsp.exe, eventually leading to the abuse of msxsl.exe as we reported in April 2021.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>The social engineering method for this current more_eggs campaign consisted of disguising a zipped copy of the VenomLNK malware as a job applicants resume. A benign PDF resume is included as well, which serves as a decoy resume, while more_eggs installs TerraLoader.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>As with previous more_eggs variants observed by TRU, the malware abuses legitimate Windows processes to evade detection, alongside a decoy document to trick users. With the incident involving the accounting firm, an employee of the firm received what they thought was a candidates resume, when in actuality the resume was the VenomLNK malware. Once VenomLNK was executed, it proceeded to execute TerraLoader so that TerraLoader could then load various information stealing and intrusion modules of the more_eggs malware suite. With this campaign however, there are two notable differences:</li>

See The Interworkings of More_Eggs section for more.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>VenomLNK is a poisoned LNK file. Windows uses LNK files to automate program execution. More_eggs uses a maliciously-written LNK file to execute TerraLoader by tricking the user into opening what they think is a document.<br/>TerraLoader loads the other modules from VenomLNK.<br/>TerraPreter provides a Meterpreter (a Metasploit attack payload) shell in memory.<br/>TerraStealer is an info stealing module used to exfiltrate sensitive data.<br/>TerraTV allows threat actors to hijack TeamViewer for lateral movement.<br/>TerraCrypt is a ransomware plugin for PureLocker ransomware, aka CR1 Ransomware, a lesser-known ransomware.</li>
