However, during that campaign, rather than posing as hopeful job candidates sending a poisoned resume, the threat actors targeted professionals on LinkedIn who were looking for jobs. The hackers sent the job seekers .zip files disguised as job offers. When the targets opened the zip file, it led to the installation of more_eggs. The threat actors behind the campaign tried enticing the targets into clicking on the zip file by naming the file after the job seekers current job title and adding position at the end.\nFor example, if the LinkedIn members job is listed as Senior Account ExecutiveInternational Freight, the malicious zip file would be titled Senior Account Executive International Freight position. Upon opening the fake job offer, the victim unwittingly initiated the installation of more_eggs."

We also know that the more_eggs Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) is known to be utilized by the very capable FIN6, Evilnum\nand Cobalt\ncybercriminals.\nOf course, for a threat group to get a foothold into the IT environments of an aerospace/ defense company, an international law firm, an international CPA firm and a national corporate staffing agency could be very lucrative. Successfully infecting a corporate employee with the more_eggs malware could potentially enable a threat actor(s) to commit a variety of cybercrimes including deploying ransomware, stealing intellectual property, stealing credentials to corporate bank accounts, or committing business email compromise, among others."

            "text": "FIN6 - FIN6 is a financial cybercrime group that primarily steals payment card data and sells it on underground marketplaces. The FIN6 group first gained notoriety in 2014 for their attacks against point-of-sale (POS) machines in retail outlets and hospitality companies. Continuing their quest for credit and debit card data, they later moved on to targeting e-Commerce companies and stole their credit card data via online skimming. The FIN6 threat group has also been known to infect some of their victims with ransomware.\nInterestingly, intelligence analysts with Visa reported in February2019 that at the end of 2018, FIN6 was specifically targeting numerous e-Commerce companies payment servers and using malicious documents to infect their targets with more_eggs as the initial phase of their attack.\nThat activity mirrors a threat campaign that was reported separately in February 2019 by ProofPoint researchers. In these incidents, threat actors were observed attacking retail, entertainment and pharmaceutical companies online payments systems and using malicious documents, laden with more_eggs, to target the companies employees. The threat actors sent fake job offers to the employees, cleverly using the job title listed on their LinkedIn profiles, in their communications. The campaigns reported in February 2019 by Visa and ProofPoint could be the same operation or, they could be two separate campaigns. However, what we do know is that the targets (eCommerce companies payment systems) and tools (more_eggs) were used in both scams.\nLater in August 2019, the FIN6 operators launched another malicious campaign, and researchers believe with this operation FIN6 was actively going after multinational organizations. Similar to the February 2019 campaign launched against the retail, entertainment, and pharmaceutical companies; employees were spearphished with fake job offers. According to security researchers, to gain access to victim environments, the threat actor began by targeting handpicked employees using LinkedIn messaging and email, advertising fake jobs to lure recipients into checking into the supposed offers.\nBetween the end of 2018 and April 2021, there have been three distinct more_eggs LinkedIn campaigns using the same Modus Operandi. Each campaign targeted corporate employees, utilized their LinkedIn profile, and then social engineered them with bogus job offers, which lead to the more_eggs malware.\nEvilnum - The Evilnum cybercrime group is best known for compromising financial technology companies, which are companies that provide stock trading platforms and tools. Their target is financial information about the targeted FINTECH companies and their customers. They target items such as spreadsheets and documents with customer lists, investments and trading operations and credentials for trading software/platforms and software.The Evilnum group is also known to spearphish employees of the companies they are targeting and enclose malicious zip files. If executed, the employees get hit with the more_eggs backdoor, along with other malware.\nCobalt Group - The Cobalt Group is also known to go after financial companies, and it has repeatedly used the more_eggs backdoor in their attacks."

            "text": "More_eggs is a sophisticated suite of malware components. One of those components is VenomLink (a component used to trick the victim into installing TerraLoader). TerraLoader is an intermediate component used to install numerous modules designed to take malicious actions such as credential theft, lateral movement, and file encryption throughout a victims IT network. A complete analysis of the 2020 version of more_eggs was conducted by Quo Intelligence, who broke the malware into several modules. Here is a full breakdown:\nVenomLNK is a poisoned LNK file. Windows uses LNK files to automate program execution. More_eggs uses a maliciously-written LNK file to execute TerraLoader by tricking the user into opening what they think is a document.\nTerraLoader loads the other modules from VenomLNK.\nTerraPreter provides a Meterpreter (a Metasploit attack payload) shell in memory.\nTerraStealer is an info stealing module used to exfiltrate sensitive data.\nTerraTV allows threat actors to hijack TeamViewer for lateral movement.\nTerraCrypt is a ransomware plugin for PureLocker ransomware, aka CR1 Ransomware, a lesser-known ransomware.\nThe social engineering method for this current more_eggs campaign consisted of disguising a zipped copy of the VenomLNK malware as a job applicants resume. A benign PDF resume is included as well, which serves as a decoy resume, while more_eggs installs TerraLoader.\nAs with previous more_eggs variants observed by TRU, the malware abuses legitimate Windows processes to evade detection, alongside a decoy document to trick users. With the incident involving the accounting firm, an employee of the firm received what they thought was a candidates resume, when in actuality the resume was the VenomLNK malware. Once VenomLNK was executed, it proceeded to execute TerraLoader so that TerraLoader could then load various information stealing and intrusion modules of the more_eggs malware suite. With this campaign however, there are two notable differences:\nAs stated earlier, rather than targeting hopeful candidates looking for work, the hackers are targeting businesses looking for employees.\nIn place of the previously abused Windows process, cmstp.exe which manages network connections more_eggs is abusing ie4uinit.exe, another Windows Process, to load its malicious plugins."

Because malware like more_eggs takes the so-called fileless approach to evade AV, there is no malicious executable for AV to detect. Rather, more_eggs achieves execution by passing malicious code to legitimate windows processes and letting those windows processes do the work for them.\nWe tend to see threat campaigns, involving the sophisticated and versatile more_eggs malware, just a few times a year compared to some other threats. In addition to the spearphishing component, this indicates to me that threat actors, using the more_eggs service, are selective and patient.\nThis year the more_eggs operation has flipped the social engineering script, targeting hiring managers with fake resumes instead of targeting jobseekers with fake job offers.\nThe threat actors behind more_eggs use a scalable, spearphishing approach that weaponizes expected communications, such as resumes, that match a hiring managers expectations or job offers, targeting hopeful candidates, that match their current or past job titles."

Malware that abuses LOLBINs bypasses binary detection approaches. Therefore, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents need to be installed on all hosts. An EDR solution is a necessary technology for detecting threats such as more_eggs ,and EDR agents must be continuously monitored and updated with the evolving threat landscape. If not, then critical alerts will not be triaged and investigated. Managed Detection and Response (MDR) providers offer this service. Robust and comprehensive MDR services require an AI-powered Extended Detection and Response (XDR) technology platform so that the hundreds of daily security signals, generated by an organizations EDR agents, can be promptly ingested, analyzed and responded to. Security events which can be resolved through an automated response are processed, while security events requiring a hands-on response are handled by the MDRs cybersecurity analysts and threat hunters.\nMonitor the Threat Landscape. Organizations need relevant threat intelligence, and it must be actioned in a timely fashion. Additionally, ones security team needs to be specifically informed about an organizations operating environment, working in concert with ones security provider.\nIf youre not currently engaged with a Managed Detection and Response provider, we highly recommend you partner with us for security services to disrupt threats before they impact your business.
