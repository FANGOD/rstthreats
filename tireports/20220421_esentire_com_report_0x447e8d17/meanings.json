                        "Thus far, in the current more_eggs campaign, the eSentire TRU team has discovered and shut down four separate security incidents. Three of them occurred at the end of March, and they all involve the new variant of more_eggs. The organizations attacked include a U.S.-based aerospace/defense company that designs, develops and provides maintenance repair for airline components; a large UK-based CPA firm; an international business law firm based out of Canada; and a national Canadian staffing agency.",
                        "Of course, for a threat group to get a foothold into the IT environments of an aerospace/ defense company, an international law firm, an international CPA firm and a national corporate staffing agency could be very lucrative. Successfully infecting a corporate employee with the more_eggs malware could potentially enable a threat actor(s) to commit a variety of cybercrimes including deploying ransomware, stealing intellectual property, stealing credentials to corporate bank accounts, or committing business email compromise, among others.",
                        "A more_eggs malware campaign has appeared, just as it did last year during the Easter season. eSentires Threat Response Unit (TRU) security research team has discovered a phishing campaign where hackers are posing as job applicants and luring Corporate Hiring Managers into downloading what they believe are resumes from job applicants. However, the bogus resumes contain the more_eggs malware.",
                        "Since these more_eggs attacks were disrupted, the TRU team cannot know with certainty what the end game is for this operation or what threat group is behind these attacks. What we do know is that this current activity demonstrates a role-reversal from last years more_eggs LinkedIn campaign. We also know that the more_eggs Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) is known to be utilized by the very capable FIN6, Evilnum<crlf>and Cobalt<crlf>cybercriminals.",
                        "Cobalt Group - The Cobalt Group is also known to go after financial companies, and it has repeatedly used the more_eggs backdoor in their attacks.",
                        "Anti-Virus(AV) is not enough to protect employees and home users from cyber threats. Because malware like more_eggs takes the so-called fileless approach to evade AV, there is no malicious executable for AV to detect. Rather, more_eggs achieves execution by passing malicious code to legitimate windows processes and letting those windows processes do the work for them.",
                        "For example, if the LinkedIn members job is listed as Senior Account ExecutiveInternational Freight, the malicious zip file would be titled Senior Account Executive International Freight position. Upon opening the fake job offer, the victim unwittingly initiated the installation of more_eggs.",
                        "eSentires<crlf>security research team, the Threat Response Unit (TRU), has discovered that the stealthy more_eggs malware has re-emerged once again this year infecting corporate entities. More_eggs is malicious software containing several components engineered to steal valuable credentials, including usernames and passwords for corporate bank accounts, email accounts and IT administrator accounts, among others.",
                        "Between the end of 2018 and April 2021, there have been three distinct more_eggs LinkedIn campaigns using the same Modus Operandi. Each campaign targeted corporate employees, utilized their LinkedIn profile, and then social engineered them with bogus job offers, which lead to the more_eggs malware.",

If not, then critical alerts will not be triaged and investigated. Managed Detection and Response (MDR) providers offer this service. Robust and comprehensive MDR services require an AI-powered Extended Detection and Response (XDR) technology platform so that the hundreds of daily security signals, generated by an organizations EDR agents, can be promptly ingested, analyzed and responded to.

                        "The social engineering method for this current more_eggs campaign consisted of disguising a zipped copy of the VenomLNK malware as a job applicants resume. A benign PDF resume is included as well, which serves as a decoy resume, while more_eggs installs TerraLoader.",

                        "That activity mirrors a threat campaign that was reported separately in February 2019 by ProofPoint researchers. In these incidents, threat actors were observed attacking retail, entertainment and pharmaceutical companies online payments systems and using malicious documents, laden with more_eggs, to target the companies employees. The threat actors sent fake job offers to the employees, cleverly using the job title listed on their LinkedIn profiles, in their communications. The campaigns reported in February 2019 by Visa and ProofPoint could be the same operation or, they could be two separate campaigns. However, what we do know is that the targets (eCommerce companies payment systems) and tools (more_eggs) were used in both scams.",

The hackers sent the job seekers .zip files disguised as job offers. When the targets opened the zip file, it led to the installation of more_eggs.

                        "The current threat campaign utilizes several similar features TRU observed in the 2021 more_eggs LinkedIn operation including: the VenomLNK module, including a decoy document, and .lnk file, and multi-phase execution through writing and reading .txt files (which turned out to be .xml files with JavaScript contents upon inspection). The TerraLoader equivalent, however, abuses ie4uinit.exe instead of cmstsp.exe, eventually leading to the abuse of msxsl.exe as we reported in April 2021.",
                        "Interestingly, intelligence analysts with Visa reported in February2019 that at the end of 2018, FIN6 was specifically targeting numerous e-Commerce companies payment servers and using malicious documents to infect their targets with more_eggs as the initial phase of their attack.",

Once accessed, the hackers exfiltrate data from the victim organization, spread to other computer hosts via TeamViewer, and encrypt files. The Golden Chickens group (aka Venom Spider) is believed to be the threat operators behind more_eggs.

With the incident involving the accounting firm, an employee of the firm received what they thought was a candidates resume, when in actuality the resume was the VenomLNK malware. Once VenomLNK was executed, it proceeded to execute TerraLoader so that TerraLoader could then load various information stealing and intrusion modules of the more_eggs malware suite.

Continuing their quest for credit and debit card data, they later moved on to targeting e-Commerce companies and stole their credit card data via online skimming. The FIN6 threat group has also been known to infect some of their victims with ransomware.",

Similar to the February 2019 campaign launched against the retail, entertainment, and pharmaceutical companies; employees were spearphished with fake job offers. According to security researchers, to gain access to victim environments, the threat actor began by targeting handpicked employees using LinkedIn messaging and email, advertising fake jobs to lure recipients into checking into the supposed offers."

However, during that operation, the threat actors were targeting professionals on LinkedIn who were looking for jobs, as opposed to Hiring Managers looking for job candidates. The hackers sent the job seekers .zip files disguised as job offers. When the targets opened the zip file, it led to the installation of more_eggs.",
                        "Thus far, TRU has discovered and shut down four separate security incidents relating to the current more_eggs campaign. Three of them occurred at the end of March, and the organizations attacked include a U.S.-based aerospace/defense company; a large UK-based CPA firm; an international business law firm based out of Canada; and a national Canadian staffing agency. TRU has produced a full report outlining their findings and how best to protect against the current more_eggs threat."

For example, be wary of Word and Excel documents sent from an unknown source or acquired from the Internet that prompts you to Enable Macros.Avoid free versions of paid software.Always inspect the full URL before downloading files to ensure it matches the source (e.g., Microsoft Team should come from a Microsoft domain).Inspect file extensions. Do not trust the filetype logo alone. An executable file can be disguised as a PDF or office document.Ensure standard procedures are in place for employees to submit potentially malicious content for review<crlf>Avoid downloading and executing files from unverified sources.

Malware that abuses LOLBINs bypasses binary detection approaches. Therefore, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents need to be installed on all hosts. An EDR solution is a necessary technology for detecting threats such as more_eggs ,and EDR agents must be continuously monitored and updated with the evolving threat landscape. If not, then critical alerts will not be triaged and investigated. Managed Detection and Response (MDR) providers offer this service. Robust and comprehensive MDR services require an AI-powered Extended Detection and Response (XDR) technology platform so that the hundreds of daily security signals, generated by an organizations EDR agents, can be promptly ingested, analyzed and responded to. Security events which can be resolved through an automated response are processed, while security events requiring a hands-on response are handled by the MDRs cybersecurity analysts and threat hunters.<crlf>Monitor the Threat Landscape. Organizations need relevant threat intelligence, and it must be actioned in a timely fashion. Additionally, ones security team needs to be specifically informed about an organizations operating environment, working in concert with ones security provider."
