Research began with a variant that uses a combination of known techniques to deliver, persist and sideload a Chrome extension.

During analysis of the original samples, an additional variant was discovered that targets Safari browser usage and employs a combination of AppleScript and Python to accomplish similar browser hijacking activity. At the time of writing, more than 15 unique dropper files have been found for this particular variant."}
