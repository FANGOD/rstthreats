                        "Whilst Denonia is clearly designed to execute inside of Lambda environments we havent yet identified how it is deployed. It may simply be a matter of compromising AWS Access and Secret Keys then manually deploying into compromised Lambda environments, as weve seen before with more simple Python scripts.",
                        "Using DoH is a fairly unusual choice for the Denonia authors, but provides two advantages here:",
                        "Interestingly this isnt the only sample of Denonia. Whilst the first sample we looked at dates from the end of February, we also found a second sample that was uploaded to VirusTotal in January 2022:",
                        "Cado Labs routinely analyses cloud environments to look for the latest threats. As part of ongoing research, we found the first publicly-known case of malware specifically designed to execute in an AWS Lambda environment. We named this malware Denonia, after the name the attackers gave the domain it communicates with. The malware uses newer address resolution techniques for command and control traffic to evade typical detection measures and virtual network access controls. Although this first sample is fairly innocuous in that it only runs crypto-mining software, it demonstrates how attackers are using advanced cloud-specific knowledge to exploit complex cloud infrastructure, and is indicative of potential future, more nefarious attacks. From the telemetry we have seen, the distribution of Denonia so far has been limited.",
                        "Denonia then starts XMRig from memory, and communicates with the attacker controlled Mining pool at 116.203.4[.]0:3333:",

We named this malware Denonia, after the name the attackers gave the domain it communicates with. The malware uses newer address resolution techniques for command and control traffic to evade typical detection measures and virtual network access controls. Although this first sample is fairly innocuous in that it only runs crypto-mining software, it demonstrates how attackers are using advanced cloud-specific knowledge to exploit complex cloud infrastructure, and is indicative of potential future, more nefarious attacks.
