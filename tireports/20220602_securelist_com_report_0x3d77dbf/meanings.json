Overall, WinDealer is able to collect an impressive amount of information, even when compared to other malware families. And yet, the most extraordinary aspect of WinDealer lies elsewhere.",

                        "In 2020, we discovered a whole new distribution method for the WinDealer malware that leverages the automatic update mechanism of select legitimate applications. In one case we investigated, we noticed that a signed executable qgametool.exe (MD5 f756083b62ba45dcc6a4d2d2727780e4), compiled in 2012, deployed WinDealer on a target machine. This program contains a hardcoded URL that it uses to check for updates, as shown in the following screenshot:",
                        "Our analysis of WinDealer reveals that it specifically looks for popular applications in Asia, such as QQ, WeChat and WangWang. It also contains references to registry keys created by Sogou programs. This indicates to us that the LuoYu APT is predominantly focused on Chinese-speaking targets and organizations related to China. Our telemetry confirms that the vast majority of LuoYu targets are located in China, with occasional infections in other countries such as Germany, Austria, the United States, Czech Republic, Russia and India.",
                        "Confirming our assessment, we later discovered a downloader utility (MD5 4e07a477039b37790f7a8e976024eb66) that uses the same unique user-agent as WinDealer samples we analyzed (BBB), tying it weakly to LuoYu.",
                        "We also identified online message board posts where Chinese-speaking users reported the discovery of malware under the same name PPTV(pplive)_forap_1084_9993.exe on their machine. The posted information was complete enough for us to confirm that they had indeed received a sample of WinDealer.<crlf>Leaving the mystery of the delivery method aside for now, lets look at the capabilities of the malware itself.",

                        "The latest WinDealer sample we discovered in 2020 doesnt contain a hardcoded C2 server but instead relies on a complex IP generation algorithm to determine which machine to contact. The details of this algorithm are left as an exercise to the reader, but the end result is that the IP address is selected at random from one of these two ranges:",

One noteworthy observation is that the attackers specifically target plain HTTP sessions, indicating that they may not have the ability to break or downgrade HTTPS.",
                        "WinDealer is a modular malware platform. It starts execution by locating an embedded DLL file placed in its resources by looking for a hardcoded pattern, and proceeds to decode it using a 10-byte XOR key.",
                        "The executable located at this URL (hxxp://download.pplive[.]com/PPTV(pplive)_forap_1084_9993.exe, MD5 270902c6bb6844dc25ffaec801393245) is benign, but our telemetry shows that on rare occasions, a WinDealer sample (MD5 ce65092fe9959cc0ee5a8408987e3cd4) is delivered instead.",
                        "LuoYu is a lesser-known threat actor that has been active since 2008. It primarily goes after targets located in China, such as foreign diplomatic organizations established in the country, members of the academic community, or companies from the defense, logistics and telecommunications sectors. In their initial disclosures on this threat actor, TeamT5 identified three malware families: SpyDealer, Demsty and WinDealer. The actor behind these families is capable of targeting Windows, Linux and macOS machines, as well as Android devices.",
                        "Once the IP address has been selected, communications take place either over UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556. In an even weirder twist, a research partner shared with us an additional WinDealer sample (MD5 d9a6725b6a2b38f96974518ec9e361ab) that communicates with the hardcoded URL http://www[.]microsoftcom/status/getsign.asp. This domain is obviously invalid and cannot resolve to anything in normal circumstances yet the malware expects a response in a predetermined format (\\x11\\x22\\x??\\x33\\x44).",
                        "In previous years, Kaspersky investigated LuoYus activities and was able to confirm the connection between Demsty and WinDealer. On January 27, we delivered a joint presentation with TeamT5 and ITOCHU Corporation at Japan Security Analyst Conference (JSAC) to provide an update on the actors latest activities. In this article, we will focus on one of the most groundbreaking developments: the fact that LuoYu has the ability to perform man-on-the-side attacks.",

                        "Our analysis of WinDealer reveals that it specifically looks for popular applications in Asia, such as QQ, WeChat and WangWang. It also contains references to registry keys created by Sogou programs. This indicates to us that the LuoYu APT is predominantly focused on Chinese-speaking targets and organizations related to China. Our telemetry confirms that the vast majority of LuoYu targets are located in China, with occasional infections in other countries such as Germany, Austria, the United States, Czech Republic, Russia and India.",
                        "Confirming our assessment, we later discovered a downloader utility (MD5 4e07a477039b37790f7a8e976024eb66) that uses the same unique user-agent as WinDealer samples we analyzed (BBB), tying it weakly to LuoYu.",
                        "In the past, LuoYu used watering-hole attacks (for instance, on local news websites) to infect their targets. Seeing that some variants of their Android malware impersonate a popular messaging app in Asia, it is also likely that malicious APKs are distributed in a variety of ways, including social engineering to convince users to install fake updates for their applications.",
                        "LuoYu is a lesser-known threat actor that has been active since 2008. It primarily goes after targets located in China, such as foreign diplomatic organizations established in the country, members of the academic community, or companies from the defense, logistics and telecommunications sectors. In their initial disclosures on this threat actor, TeamT5 identified three malware families: SpyDealer, Demsty and WinDealer. The actor behind these families is capable of targeting Windows, Linux and macOS machines, as well as Android devices.",
                        "In recent months, LuoYu has started to widen its scope to companies and users in East Asia and their branches located in China.",
                        "With this report, we recognize LuoYu as an extremely sophisticated threat actor able to leverage capabilities available only to the most mature attackers. We can only speculate as to how they were able to obtain such capabilities. They could have compromised routers on the route to (or inside) AS4134. Alternatively, they may use signals intelligence methods unknown to the general public. They may even have access (legitimate or fraudulent) to law enforcement tools set up at the ISP level and are abusing them to perform offensive operations. Overall, a threat actor is leveraging capabilities that could be compared (but are distinct) from the QUANTUMINSERT program in order to infect targets located in China.",
                        "In previous years, Kaspersky investigated LuoYus activities and was able to confirm the connection between Demsty and WinDealer. On January 27, we delivered a joint presentation with TeamT5 and ITOCHU Corporation at Japan Security Analyst Conference (JSAC) to provide an update on the actors latest activities. In this article, we will focus on one of the most groundbreaking developments: the fact that LuoYu has the ability to perform man-on-the-side attacks."

Alternatively, they may use signals intelligence methods unknown to the general public. They may even have access (legitimate or fraudulent) to law enforcement tools set up at the ISP level and are abusing them to perform offensive operations. Overall, a threat actor is leveraging capabilities that could be compared (but are distinct) from the QUANTUMINSERT program in order to infect targets located in China."

                        "With this report, we recognize LuoYu as an extremely sophisticated threat actor able to leverage capabilities available only to the most mature attackers. We can only speculate as to how they were able to obtain such capabilities. They could have compromised routers on the route to (or inside) AS4134. Alternatively, they may use signals intelligence methods unknown to the general public. They may even have access (legitimate or fraudulent) to law enforcement tools set up at the ISP level and are abusing them to perform offensive operations. Overall, a threat actor is leveraging capabilities that could be compared (but are distinct) from the QUANTUMINSERT program in order to infect targets located in China."

The general idea is that when the attacker sees a request for a specific resource on the network, it tries to reply to the target faster than the legitimate server. If the attacker wins the race, the target machine will use the attacker-supplied data instead of the normal data. This is consistent with the scenario described earlier in this article, where the target receives an infected executable instead of the normal one. Automatic updaters are prime targets for such attacks as they perform frequent requests it doesnt matter if the attackers dont win most races, as they can try again until they succeed, guaranteeing that they will infect their targets eventually. This class of attack is particularly devastating because there is nothing users can do to protect themselves, apart from routing traffic through another network. This can be done with the use of a VPN, but these may be illegal depending on the jurisdiction and would typically not be available to Chinese-speaking targets."

                        "Such capabilities are not unheard of: the QUANTUM program revealed in 2014 was the first known instance. The general idea is that when the attacker sees a request for a specific resource on the network, it tries to reply to the target faster than the legitimate server. If the attacker wins the race, the target machine will use the attacker-supplied data instead of the normal data. This is consistent with the scenario described earlier in this article, where the target receives an infected executable instead of the normal one. Automatic updaters are prime targets for such attacks as they perform frequent requests it doesnt matter if the attackers dont win most races, as they can try again until they succeed, guaranteeing that they will infect their targets eventually. This class of attack is particularly devastating because there is nothing users can do to protect themselves, apart from routing traffic through another network. This can be done with the use of a VPN, but these may be illegal depending on the jurisdiction and would typically not be available to Chinese-speaking targets."

We can only speculate as to how they were able to obtain such capabilities. They could have compromised routers on the route to (or inside) AS4134. Alternatively, they may use signals intelligence methods unknown to the general public. They may even have access (legitimate or fraudulent) to law enforcement tools set up at the ISP level and are abusing them to perform offensive operations. Overall, a threat actor is leveraging capabilities that could be compared (but are distinct) from the QUANTUMINSERT program in order to infect targets located in China."
