They have been targeting government networks in Europe and NATO member nations, research institutes, and think tanks since at least 2008. APT29 focuses on a single target, launching a payload in the first stage that investigates the area while establishing persistence. Also, the notorious Solar Wind attacks in 2020 were carried out by this group. In 2014, the APT29 group attacked commercial and government enterprises in Germany, Uzbekistan, South Korea, and the United States, including the US State Department and the White House."

The exploit document uses the template injection technique to infect the victims computer with further malware. When the document is opened, it connects to the hackers server and downloads the payload file. Gamaredons tools are simple and designed to collect sensitive information from hacked systems and propagate it further. Its information-gathering efforts are nearly comparable to those of a second-tier APT, whose primary purpose is to collect and disseminate information with their units.",

Its been utilized against large companies and government institutions across the world, especially in North America. Conti steals important files and information from targeted networks and threatens to disseminate it unless the ransom is paid. Conti ransomware enhances performance by utilizing up to 32 simultaneous encryption operations, and is very likely directly controlled by its controllers. This ransomware can target network-based resources while ignoring local files.

Its been utilized against large companies and government institutions across the world, especially in North America. Conti steals important files and information from targeted networks and threatens to disseminate it unless the ransom is paid. Conti ransomware enhances performance by utilizing up to 32 simultaneous encryption operations, and is very likely directly controlled by its controllers. This ransomware can target network-based resources while ignoring local files. This feature has the noticeable impact of being able to create targeted harm in an environment in a way that might hinder incident response actions."

APT29 focuses on a single target, launching a payload in the first stage that investigates the area while establishing persistence.

Its been utilized against large companies and government institutions across the world, especially in North America. Conti steals important files and information from targeted networks and threatens to disseminate it unless the ransom is paid. Conti ransomware enhances performance by utilizing up to 32 simultaneous encryption operations, and is very likely directly controlled by its controllers. This ransomware can target network-based resources while ignoring local files. This feature has the noticeable impact of being able to create targeted harm in an environment in a way that might hinder incident response actions.",

These attacks mostly involve cyber crimes against the defense and military of targeted countries. To support Russias national interests, APT28 compromises the targeted countrys operation, steals their data, and then leaks it to their government."

This malware is mostly used to load additional malicious software, which is often obtained from a third-party source. SmokeLoader can load its modules allowing it to do several activities without the use of additional components. To date, the supplier of Smokeloader, who goes by the alias SmokeLdr, is still active in delivering this malware as a service. It is well-known for using deception and self-defense. This malware can be spread in several ways and is widely linked to criminal activity. To hide its C2 activity, this malware sends queries to popular websites like microsoft.com, bing.com, adobe.com, and others."

APT29 focuses on a single target, launching a payload in the first stage that investigates the area while establishing persistence. Also, the notorious Solar Wind attacks in 2020 were carried out by this group. In 2014, the APT29 group attacked commercial and government enterprises in Germany, Uzbekistan, South Korea, and the United States, including the US State Department and the White House."

The main goal of this APT is to use the malicious document to gain control of the target machine. The exploit document uses the template injection technique to infect the victims computer with further malware. When the document is opened, it connects to the hackers server and downloads the payload file. Gamaredons tools are simple and designed to collect sensitive information from hacked systems and propagate it further. Its information-gathering efforts are nearly comparable to those of a second-tier APT, whose primary purpose is to collect and disseminate information with their units."
