Also, the notorious Solar Wind attacks in 2020 were carried out by this group. In 2014, the APT29 group attacked commercial and government enterprises in Germany, Uzbekistan, South Korea, and the United States, including the US State Department and the White House.</li>

The main goal of this APT is to use the malicious document to gain control of the target machine. The exploit document uses the template injection technique to infect the victims computer with further malware. When the document is opened, it connects to the hackers server and downloads the payload file. Gamaredons tools are simple and designed to collect sensitive information from hacked systems and propagate it further. Its information-gathering efforts are nearly comparable to those of a second-tier APT, whose primary purpose is to collect and disseminate information with their units.</li>

                                        <li>APT28 is one of Russias longest-running APTs and its operations date back to at least 2007. The group supports Russia in their strategic operations against the U.S, countries of the former Soviet Union, Europe, and now Asia. These attacks mostly involve cyber crimes against the defense and military of targeted countries. To support Russias national interests, APT28 compromises the targeted countrys operation, steals their data, and then leaks it to their government.</li>

                                        <li>Recently, APT 28 (allegedly) has attacked Eastern European countries using Empire and Invoke-Obfuscation. The MSHTML Remote Code Execution vulnerability, CVE-2021-40444, is being used by their threat actors.</li>

                                        <li>Gamaredon is a Russia-backed advanced persistent threat (APT) that has been operating since at least 2013. The main goal of this APT is to use the malicious document to gain control of the target machine. The exploit document uses the template injection technique to infect the victims computer with further malware. When the document is opened, it connects to the hackers server and downloads the payload file. Gamaredons tools are simple and designed to collect sensitive information from hacked systems and propagate it further. Its information-gathering efforts are nearly comparable to those of a second-tier APT, whose primary purpose is to collect and disseminate information with their units.</li>

                                        <li>Conti ransomware was discovered in December 2019 and is delivered via TrickBot. Its been utilized against large companies and government institutions across the world, especially in North America. Conti steals important files and information from targeted networks and threatens to disseminate it unless the ransom is paid. Conti ransomware enhances performance by utilizing up to 32 simultaneous encryption operations, and is very likely directly controlled by its controllers. This ransomware can target network-based resources while ignoring local files. This feature has the noticeable impact of being able to create targeted harm in an environment in a way that might hinder incident response actions.</li>

                                        <li>Conti ransomware was discovered in December 2019 and is delivered via TrickBot. Its been utilized against large companies and government institutions across the world, especially in North America. Conti steals important files and information from targeted networks and threatens to disseminate it unless the ransom is paid. Conti ransomware enhances performance by utilizing up to 32 simultaneous encryption operations, and is very likely directly controlled by its controllers. This ransomware can target network-based resources while ignoring local files. This feature has the noticeable impact of being able to create targeted harm in an environment in a way that might hinder incident response actions.</li>

Also, the notorious Solar Wind attacks in 2020 were carried out by this group. In 2014, the APT29 group attacked commercial and government enterprises in Germany, Uzbekistan, South Korea, and the United States, including the US State Department and the White House.</li>

To support Russias national interests, APT28 compromises the targeted countrys operation, steals their data, and then leaks it to their government.</li>

                                        <li>Conti ransomware was discovered in December 2019 and is delivered via TrickBot. Its been utilized against large companies and government institutions across the world, especially in North America. Conti steals important files and information from targeted networks and threatens to disseminate it unless the ransom is paid. Conti ransomware enhances performance by utilizing up to 32 simultaneous encryption operations, and is very likely directly controlled by its controllers. This ransomware can target network-based resources while ignoring local files. This feature has the noticeable impact of being able to create targeted harm in an environment in a way that might hinder incident response actions.</li>

                                        <li>Conti ransomware was discovered in December 2019 and is delivered via TrickBot. Its been utilized against large companies and government institutions across the world, especially in North America. Conti steals important files and information from targeted networks and threatens to disseminate it unless the ransom is paid. Conti ransomware enhances performance by utilizing up to 32 simultaneous encryption operations, and is very likely directly controlled by its controllers. This ransomware can target network-based resources while ignoring local files. This feature has the noticeable impact of being able to create targeted harm in an environment in a way that might hinder incident response actions.</li>

SmokeLoader has been spotted in the wild since 2011, carrying a variety of payloads. This malware is mostly used to load additional malicious software, which is often obtained from a third-party source. SmokeLoader can load its modules allowing it to do several activities without the use of additional components. To date, the supplier of Smokeloader, who goes by the alias SmokeLdr, is still active in delivering this malware as a service. It is well-known for using deception and self-defense. This malware can be spread in several ways and is widely linked to criminal activity. To hide its C2 activity, this malware sends queries to popular websites like microsoft.com, bing.com, adobe.com, and others.</li>

                                        <li>Gamaredon is a Russia-backed advanced persistent threat (APT) that has been operating since at least 2013. The main goal of this APT is to use the malicious document to gain control of the target machine. The exploit document uses the template injection technique to infect the victims computer with further malware. When the document is opened, it connects to the hackers server and downloads the payload file. Gamaredons tools are simple and designed to collect sensitive information from hacked systems and propagate it further. Its information-gathering efforts are nearly comparable to those of a second-tier APT, whose primary purpose is to collect and disseminate information with their units.</li>

SmokeLoader has been spotted in the wild since 2011, carrying a variety of payloads. This malware is mostly used to load additional malicious software, which is often obtained from a third-party source. SmokeLoader can load its modules allowing it to do several activities without the use of additional components. To date, the supplier of Smokeloader, who goes by the alias SmokeLdr, is still active in delivering this malware as a service. It is well-known for using deception and self-defense. This malware can be spread in several ways and is widely linked to criminal activity. To hide its C2 activity, this malware sends queries to popular websites like microsoft.com, bing.com, adobe.com, and others.</li>

                                        <li>The cybersecurity authorities of the United States, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, and New Zealand have released a joint CSA (Cybersecurity Advisory). The advisory is against Russias continuous cyber attacks against Ukraine in an attempt to completely invade it. This has also opened up doors for Russian cybercriminals to attack what they deem Enemies of Russia. Countries allying with Ukraine and sanctioning the actions by Russia are at high risk of attacks too. These attacks also include DDoS, Ransomware, and deployment of malicious software for information theft. Cyber threat actors from the following Russian government and military organizations have conducted malicious cyber operations against IT and/or OT networks:</li>
                                    
                                        <li>APT29 is linked to Russias Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). They have been targeting government networks in Europe and NATO member nations, research institutes, and think tanks since at least 2008. APT29 focuses on a single target, launching a payload in the first stage that investigates the area while establishing persistence. Also, the notorious Solar Wind attacks in 2020 were carried out by this group. In 2014, the APT29 group attacked commercial and government enterprises in Germany, Uzbekistan, South Korea, and the United States, including the US State Department and the White House.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>Conti ransomware was discovered in December 2019 and is delivered via TrickBot. Its been utilized against large companies and government institutions across the world, especially in North America. Conti steals important files and information from targeted networks and threatens to disseminate it unless the ransom is paid. Conti ransomware enhances performance by utilizing up to 32 simultaneous encryption operations, and is very likely directly controlled by its controllers. This ransomware can target network-based resources while ignoring local files. This feature has the noticeable impact of being able to create targeted harm in an environment in a way that might hinder incident response actions.</li>
                                    
                                        <li>APT28 is one of Russias longest-running APTs and its operations date back to at least 2007. The group supports Russia in their strategic operations against the U.S, countries of the former Soviet Union, Europe, and now Asia. These attacks mostly involve cyber crimes against the defense and military of targeted countries. To support Russias national interests, APT28 compromises the targeted countrys operation, steals their data, and then leaks it to their government.</li>

                                        <li>Gamaredon is a Russia-backed advanced persistent threat (APT) that has been operating since at least 2013. The main goal of this APT is to use the malicious document to gain control of the target machine. The exploit document uses the template injection technique to infect the victims computer with further malware. When the document is opened, it connects to the hackers server and downloads the payload file. Gamaredons tools are simple and designed to collect sensitive information from hacked systems and propagate it further. Its information-gathering efforts are nearly comparable to those of a second-tier APT, whose primary purpose is to collect and disseminate information with their units.</li>

                                        <li>Conti ransomware was discovered in December 2019 and is delivered via TrickBot. Its been utilized against large companies and government institutions across the world, especially in North America. Conti steals important files and information from targeted networks and threatens to disseminate it unless the ransom is paid. Conti ransomware enhances performance by utilizing up to 32 simultaneous encryption operations, and is very likely directly controlled by its controllers. This ransomware can target network-based resources while ignoring local files. This feature has the noticeable impact of being able to create targeted harm in an environment in a way that might hinder incident response actions.</li>
