This vulnerability happens due to usage of partially uninitialized memory of the pipe buffer structure during its construction. A lack of zero initialization of the new structures member results in a stale value of flags, which can be abused by an attacker to gain write access to pages in the cache even if they originally were marked with a read-only attribute.",

It affects the Linux kernels from 5.8 through any version before 5.16.11, 5.15.25 and 5.10.102, and can be used for local privilege escalation. The vulnerability resides in the pipe tool, which is used for unidirectional communication between processes, so the researcher called it Dirty Pipe.
