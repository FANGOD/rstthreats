                        "If the computer that CaddyWiper was executed on is not a domain controller (DC), the machine wont be harmed. If it is a PDC, Caddy starts wiping at C:\\\\Users in order not to break the operating system before the wiping process completes. It then deletes every drive letter from D:\\\\ drive to Z:\\\\. If Caddy was run with administrator privileges, it also deletes the partition of the physical hard drives to absolutely wreck the operating system.",
                        "As Russias invasion of Ukraine continues, new wiper malware has surfaced attacking Ukrainian infrastructure. Caddywiper was first detected on March 14, 2022. It destroys user data, partitions information from attached drives, and has been spotted on several dozen systems in a limited number of organizations. CaddyWiper has been deployed via GPO, suggesting the attackers had initially compromised the target's Active Directory server. Morphisec Labs CaddyWiper analysis follows.",
                        "This chart details the CaddyWiper execution flow:",
                        "And when CaddyWiper starts with administrator privileges, it makes the operating system useless as well:",
                        "The wiper changes the DACL of a file object by taking ownership of that object. This only succeeds if whoever starts the Caddy process has WRITE_DAC access to the object or is the owner of the object. If the initial attempt to change the DACL fails, the code enables the privilege of SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege. It then makes the local system's administrators group the owner of the object. The code used in Caddy is similar to the example that MSDN provides.",
                        "CaddyWiper can be executed with or without administrator privilege. In both cases it causes lethal damage to the target machine. CaddyWiper execution without administrator privileges makes files worthless, as seen below:",
                        "Caddy uses the process environment block (PEB) to resolve the required Windows application programming interface (API). This is to evade static and dynamic scanners. As part of reputation scoring, scanners validate for an executable import directory, and dynamic monitoring is based on imported API hooking. Caddy officially declares only on the DsRoleGetPrimaryDomainInformation API as part of its import address table (IAT) while the rest is resolved dynamically via the PEB.",
                        "Caddy is a sophisticated wiper that can transform any machine its deployed against into a very expensive door stopper. Unfortunately, traditional endpoint security solutions have a hard time preventing sophisticated attacks such as CaddyWiper. Due to its evasive, polymorphic nature, CaddyWiper hides its functionality from runtime monitoring and pattern matching. Though the impact is visible, response time is irrelevant when it gets to wipers or ransomware.",
                        "CaddyWiper is the fourth wiper observed attacking Ukrainian targets. WhisperGate was the first wiper. It was used in attacks on Ukrainian government agencies ahead of the invasion. WhisperGate was soon followed by HermeticWiper and IsaacWiper, with CaddyWiper the third wiper deployed in as many weeks.",
                        "The IOCTL (IOCTL_DISK_SET_DRIVE_LAYOUT_EX ) passed in DeviceIoControl is generally used for disk repartition according to the specified drive layout and partition information data. However, in our case, it just wipes 0x780 bytes from the physical drive while it iterates from \\\\\\\\.\\\\PHYSICALDRIVE9 and goes until \\\\\\\\.\\\\PHYSICALDRIVE0. However, it can only be done if Caddy is executed with administrator privileges."
