                        "Most Talisman PlugX samples we analyzed consist of three-file long execution chains abusing the DLL sideloading technique, which is consistent with the tactics, techniques, and procedures of Chinese state-sponsored threat actors that use this type of execution to launch their malware to evade detection by security solutions.",
                        "Within the analysis of the PlugX Talisman variant, we will reference the THOR variant of PlugX, which was discovered by Unit42, as well as an earlier version of PlugX documented by DrWeb. These articles describe other versions of PlugX and were of help to us during the analysis of this variant to both understand and compare the different iterations of the malware. Talisman has some differences with other PlugX versions. In the coming sections, we will highlight interesting segments of the malware. Below, a visual overview of the malwares stages is given.",
                        "Figure 1. Talisman PlugX execution flow",
                        "The DLL is loaded by the benign executable, as it normally would. In this case, the DLL has only a single purpose: execute shellcode to decrypt a fake log file. The shellcode is called in the DllMain function the moment the DLL is attached to the executable. Once decrypted, a new PE file is uncovered, which is PlugX main component, to which the execution is then transferred.",
                        "During our research we analysed three different Talisman PlugX samples, from which we extracted the command-and-control servers. This allowed us to cluster the actors infrastructure. We found that one of the samples (SHA-256: 6dc98a3c771f9f20d099e2d64995564dd083be9ac6ed9586a6e57c20ebd4176c) connects to dhsg123[.]jkub[.]com as the command-and-control domain. This overlaps with the RedFoxtrot group, on which Recorded Future already reported.",
                        "The first stage of the malware is a benign executable which is used to evade the prying eyes of security products as valid signatures often help to indicate the trustworthiness of a binary. The signed executables in this campaign have been created by security companies. The sole purpose of the first stage is to load a DLL which has been modified by the attacker. Sideloading a DLL is a commonly seen technique in various PlugX variants, as is also described on the respective MITRE ATT&CK page. Lastly, a third binary file, containing the encrypted Talisman payload, is decrypted by the DLL to complete the full chain of execution.",
                        "The first noteworthy action the main thread performs, is the unloading of the modified DLL from memory, minimising the amount of malicious artefacts in-memory. The rest of the malwares execution is in-line with other PlugX variants behaviour, one example being the number of command-line arguments which decide the persistence method, as well as the persistence methods themselves: varying from the creation of a key in the registers start-up folder, the creation of a scheduled task, or the creation of a service.",
                        "We want to mention that a change within the PlugX malware alone does not mean a new threat actor has emerged. The PlugX source code has allegedly circulated online already. This also means that not all PlugX samples are necessarily tied to Chinese actors, although it a prevalent tool in their kit. In the case of Talisman, there is more evidence which points towards a Chinese state-backed actor than a simple change in the malwares codebase, such as the overlaps in the used infrastructure, which is also present in Recorded Futures research. Based on this, Trellix attributes this campaign with medium confidence to the Chinese state-backed RedFoxtrot group.",
                        "PlugX has been associated with various Chinese actors in recent years. This fact raises the question if the malwares code base is shared among different Chinese state-backed groups. On the other hand, the alleged leak of the PlugX v1 builder, as reported by Airbus in 2015, indicates that not all occurrences of PlugX are necessarily tied to Chinese actors.",
                        "The Talisman PlugX configuration has a size of 0x1924 bytes and contains all the necessary values and information to properly run the executable. The following fields are contained in the Talisman configuration: a list of control panels (i.e., freewula.strangled.net), the target process that will inject (i.e., %SystemRoot%\\system32\\nslookup.exe), the malware home directory (i.e., %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\SymantecSNAC), the persist name (i.e., SymantecSNAC), the service display name (i.e., SymantecSNAC), the campaign id (i.e., TEST) and the mutex name (i.e., Global\\Restart0).",
                        "Figure 13. Talisman PlugX and PCShare connection to RedFoxtrot infrastructure",
                        "We are sharing the full list of indicators of compromise regarding the Talisman PlugX command and control servers and the infrastructure of the actor in Appendix A of this blog.",
                        "Talisman has, much like other PlugX variants, the ability to use plug-ins. Some of these are embedded by default, as also described by the United States CISA: Disk, Nethood, Netstat, Option, PortMap, RegEdit, Service, Shell, SQL, and Telnet. The plug-in names are relatively self-explanatory, as their name indicates the type of activities that can be performed with them. The screenshot below shows the first seven of the embedded plug-ins, as listed above.",
                        "Talisman is a newly discovered PlugX variant which follows the usual execution process by abusing a signed and benign binary which loads a modified DLL to execute shellcode. The shellcode is used to decrypt the PlugX malware which then serves as a backdoor with plug-in capabilities. Unlike other versions, the malwares internal configurations signature is different, as well as other minor changes within the code.",
                        "The configuration decryption routine that is used within PlugX modified DLL to decrypt Talisman differs from both aforementioned samples. The decryption routine is a piece of shellcode which can be launched as-is, as it resolves all the required functions before using them. The decryption logic differs as the used decryption constants have been altered, which can be seen in the screenshot below.",
                        "Talisman has, much like the original PlugX version, several ways of persisting itself. Depending on the number of command-line arguments, and the internal configuration, the sample may opt to not persist using one of the following methods:",
                        "If those checks are met, Talisman will call the decryption routine to decrypt the configuration with the well-known PlugX algorithm, as is shown in the image below.",
                        "For over a decade, the PlugX malware has been observed internationally with different variants found around the world. This blog covers a PlugX variant that we have named Talisman, a name we based on comparisons with other PlugX variants, and its rather long life since it first emerged in 2008. First, the malwares technical details will be discussed, after which the infrastructure, attribution, and victimology will be covered.",
                        "The encrypted configuration is fetched from SNAC.LOG, which is decrypted by the second stage DLL, rather than the Talisman PlugX binary. This is to ensure that the full execution chain (the benign executable, the modified DLL, and the encrypted SNAC.LOG file) are executed. If this is not the case, the malware will crash.",
                        "Our findings regarding the custom structure differ when comparing them to the analysis of DrWeb. Since the sample where DrWeb refers to is unavailable, we could not compare the two samples. In 2014, Takahiro Haruyama and Hiroshi Suzuki presented I Know You Want Me - Unplugging PlugX at Black Hat Asia. On slide 10, one can see the shellarg structure matches our findings. The image below shows DrWebs version of the structure, as well as the version that is found within Talisman.",
                        "Additionally, the malware connects with the command-and-control server, as is stored in the internal configuration structure. The usage of plug-ins is possible, much like other PlugX variants, if the correct signature is present in the plug-in. The following sections will highlight interesting segments of the sample.",
                        "In this blog we have analysed the different steps the infamous PlugX RAT follows to start execution and avoid detection. Moreover, we highlighted several interesting characteristics of a new variant that we dubbed Talisman. During the technical analysis, we extracted various network artifacts that allowed us to not only find new samples, but also analyse the infrastructure overlap with a known Chinese state-backed group. This information, together with the analysis of the victims where we observed this PlugX variant, allowed us to attribute this campaign with medium confidence to the RedFoxtrot APT group, which is otherwise known as Nomad Panda.",
                        "However, based on our analysis of the infrastructure overlaps with Recorded Futures related research, we assess with medium confidence that the Talisman PlugX variant discussed in this blog is used by RedFoxtrot/Nomad Panda, a Chinese state sponsored actor. The victimology is in-line with the targets of this group as well. We have no evidence that this variant is exclusively used by this threat actor, instead we believe that Talisman could be shared among different Chinese groups to carry out their operations."

This allowed us to cluster the actors infrastructure. We found that one of the samples (SHA-256: 6dc98a3c771f9f20d099e2d64995564dd083be9ac6ed9586a6e57c20ebd4176c) connects to dhsg123[.]jkub[.]com as the command-and-control domain. This overlaps with the RedFoxtrot group, on which Recorded Future already reported.",
                        "In this blog we have analysed the different steps the infamous PlugX RAT follows to start execution and avoid detection. Moreover, we highlighted several interesting characteristics of a new variant that we dubbed Talisman. During the technical analysis, we extracted various network artifacts that allowed us to not only find new samples, but also analyse the infrastructure overlap with a known Chinese state-backed group. This information, together with the analysis of the victims where we observed this PlugX variant, allowed us to attribute this campaign with medium confidence to the RedFoxtrot APT group, which is otherwise known as Nomad Panda.",
                        "We want to mention that a change within the PlugX malware alone does not mean a new threat actor has emerged. The PlugX source code has allegedly circulated online already. This also means that not all PlugX samples are necessarily tied to Chinese actors, although it a prevalent tool in their kit. In the case of Talisman, there is more evidence which points towards a Chinese state-backed actor than a simple change in the malwares codebase, such as the overlaps in the used infrastructure, which is also present in Recorded Futures research. Based on this, Trellix attributes this campaign with medium confidence to the Chinese state-backed RedFoxtrot group.",
                        "However, based on our analysis of the infrastructure overlaps with Recorded Futures related research, we assess with medium confidence that the Talisman PlugX variant discussed in this blog is used by RedFoxtrot/Nomad Panda, a Chinese state sponsored actor. The victimology is in-line with the targets of this group as well. We have no evidence that this variant is exclusively used by this threat actor, instead we believe that Talisman could be shared among different Chinese groups to carry out their operations."

Other versions are named based on their signature but given Talismans rude signature word we opted for a different name.",

These articles describe other versions of PlugX and were of help to us during the analysis of this variant to both understand and compare the different iterations of the malware. Talisman has some differences with other PlugX versions. In the coming sections, we will highlight interesting segments of the malware. Below, a visual overview of the malwares stages is given."

Pivoting on that IP, we identified two PCShare samples communicating to that IP, both of which use the same injection method into the Remote Desktop shared clipboard (RDPclip.exe). PCShare is an open-source backdoor, which has been leveraged by Chinese actors, as documented by BlackBerry. Additionally, the same mutex (being 78de65b0701f3c9238a37) is used as the ones reported by Recorded Future."

                        "Within the analysis of the PlugX Talisman variant, we will reference the THOR variant of PlugX, which was discovered by Unit42, as well as an earlier version of PlugX documented by DrWeb. These articles describe other versions of PlugX and were of help to us during the analysis of this variant to both understand and compare the different iterations of the malware. Talisman has some differences with other PlugX versions. In the coming sections, we will highlight interesting segments of the malware. Below, a visual overview of the malwares stages is given.",
                        "Most Talisman PlugX samples we analyzed consist of three-file long execution chains abusing the DLL sideloading technique, which is consistent with the tactics, techniques, and procedures of Chinese state-sponsored threat actors that use this type of execution to launch their malware to evade detection by security solutions.",
                        "The first stage of the malware is a benign executable which is used to evade the prying eyes of security products as valid signatures often help to indicate the trustworthiness of a binary. The signed executables in this campaign have been created by security companies. The sole purpose of the first stage is to load a DLL which has been modified by the attacker. Sideloading a DLL is a commonly seen technique in various PlugX variants, as is also described on the respective MITRE ATT&CK page. Lastly, a third binary file, containing the encrypted Talisman payload, is decrypted by the DLL to complete the full chain of execution.",
                        "Upon executing, the main function will resolve some functions, as these are used later. Additionally, the malware adjusts the SeDebugPrivilege and SeTcbPrivilege tokens of its own process. These two tokens ensure that the malware can, respectively, debug processes which arent owned by the current process owner, and the malware can create access tokens as if they are made by any user. Both instances allow the malware to act as the SYSTEM user, allowing free roam around the machine. The malware then creates its main thread, which is named bootProc.",
                        "The first noteworthy action the main thread performs, is the unloading of the modified DLL from memory, minimising the amount of malicious artefacts in-memory. The rest of the malwares execution is in-line with other PlugX variants behaviour, one example being the number of command-line arguments which decide the persistence method, as well as the persistence methods themselves: varying from the creation of a key in the registers start-up folder, the creation of a scheduled task, or the creation of a service.",
                        "Additionally, the malware connects with the command-and-control server, as is stored in the internal configuration structure. The usage of plug-ins is possible, much like other PlugX variants, if the correct signature is present in the plug-in. The following sections will highlight interesting segments of the sample.",
                        "Talisman is a newly discovered PlugX variant which follows the usual execution process by abusing a signed and benign binary which loads a modified DLL to execute shellcode. The shellcode is used to decrypt the PlugX malware which then serves as a backdoor with plug-in capabilities. Unlike other versions, the malwares internal configurations signature is different, as well as other minor changes within the code.",
                        "This section will deep dive into the used obfuscation techniques, briefly cover the execution flow, and provide insight into the used decryption routines, as well as the internally used structures within the malware.",
                        "We have observed the Talisman malware in a campaign which targets the telecommunication and defense sectors in South Asia. Moreover, the targets line up with the Chinese efforts to protect the Belt and Road Initiative, a program that aims to establish strong socioeconomically relationships across Europe, Asia, and Africa.",
                        "A small change like this can indicate that the actor has access to the source code of the malware, rather than a builder with an executable stub, as these generally do not provide the option for such granular changes.",
                        "Before decrypting the configuration, the malware will check for the presence of the Talisman signature and ensure that the configuration length matches. In the observed Talisman variants, the configuration size equals 0x1924 bytes, as passed by the shellarg_talisman structure, which is located at the start of the binary.",
                        "For over a decade, the PlugX malware has been observed internationally with different variants found around the world. This blog covers a PlugX variant that we have named Talisman, a name we based on comparisons with other PlugX variants, and its rather long life since it first emerged in 2008. First, the malwares technical details will be discussed, after which the infrastructure, attribution, and victimology will be covered.",
                        "We want to mention that a change within the PlugX malware alone does not mean a new threat actor has emerged. The PlugX source code has allegedly circulated online already. This also means that not all PlugX samples are necessarily tied to Chinese actors, although it a prevalent tool in their kit. In the case of Talisman, there is more evidence which points towards a Chinese state-backed actor than a simple change in the malwares codebase, such as the overlaps in the used infrastructure, which is also present in Recorded Futures research. Based on this, Trellix attributes this campaign with medium confidence to the Chinese state-backed RedFoxtrot group.",
                        "PlugX has been associated with various Chinese actors in recent years. This fact raises the question if the malwares code base is shared among different Chinese state-backed groups. On the other hand, the alleged leak of the PlugX v1 builder, as reported by Airbus in 2015, indicates that not all occurrences of PlugX are necessarily tied to Chinese actors.",
                        "We dont exactly know how the campaign_id field is used by the actors, but we presume it may be used to identify the victims, or the malware version in their operations.",
                        "The encrypted configuration is fetched from SNAC.LOG, which is decrypted by the second stage DLL, rather than the Talisman PlugX binary. This is to ensure that the full execution chain (the benign executable, the modified DLL, and the encrypted SNAC.LOG file) are executed. If this is not the case, the malware will crash."

                        "Our findings regarding the custom structure differ when comparing them to the analysis of DrWeb. Since the sample where DrWeb refers to is unavailable, we could not compare the two samples. In 2014, Takahiro Haruyama and Hiroshi Suzuki presented I Know You Want Me - Unplugging PlugX at Black Hat Asia. On slide 10, one can see the shellarg structure matches our findings. The image below shows DrWebs version of the structure, as well as the version that is found within Talisman.",
                        "The DLL is loaded by the benign executable, as it normally would. In this case, the DLL has only a single purpose: execute shellcode to decrypt a fake log file. The shellcode is called in the DllMain function the moment the DLL is attached to the executable. Once decrypted, a new PE file is uncovered, which is PlugX main component, to which the execution is then transferred.",
                        "A piece of shellcode is used to decrypt Talisman, a pointer to which is stored within a custom structure within the binary. The shellcode resolves all functions it requires and handles the decryption and the decompression of the given data blob. Additionally, the MZ-header and PE-header are verified using the offsets of 0 and 0x4550 respectively, which correspond to fields named e_magic and e_lfanew. The entry point of the newly decrypted PE file is stored in the custom structure as well. The image below shows the checks and structure field assignments in the pseudocode overview.",
                        "Talisman has, much like other PlugX variants, the ability to use plug-ins. Some of these are embedded by default, as also described by the United States CISA: Disk, Nethood, Netstat, Option, PortMap, RegEdit, Service, Shell, SQL, and Telnet. The plug-in names are relatively self-explanatory, as their name indicates the type of activities that can be performed with them. The screenshot below shows the first seven of the embedded plug-ins, as listed above.",
                        "The configuration decryption routine that is used within PlugX modified DLL to decrypt Talisman differs from both aforementioned samples. The decryption routine is a piece of shellcode which can be launched as-is, as it resolves all the required functions before using them. The decryption logic differs as the used decryption constants have been altered, which can be seen in the screenshot below.",
                        "In this blog we have analysed the different steps the infamous PlugX RAT follows to start execution and avoid detection. Moreover, we highlighted several interesting characteristics of a new variant that we dubbed Talisman. During the technical analysis, we extracted various network artifacts that allowed us to not only find new samples, but also analyse the infrastructure overlap with a known Chinese state-backed group. This information, together with the analysis of the victims where we observed this PlugX variant, allowed us to attribute this campaign with medium confidence to the RedFoxtrot APT group, which is otherwise known as Nomad Panda.",

The shellcode is used to decrypt the PlugX malware which then serves as a backdoor with plug-in capabilities. Unlike other versions, the malwares internal configurations signature is different, as well as other minor changes within the code.",

In the observed Talisman variants, the configuration size equals 0x1924 bytes, as passed by the shellarg_talisman structure, which is located at the start of the binary.",
                        "For over a decade, the PlugX malware has been observed internationally with different variants found around the world. This blog covers a PlugX variant that we have named Talisman, a name we based on comparisons with other PlugX variants, and its rather long life since it first emerged in 2008. First, the malwares technical details will be discussed, after which the infrastructure, attribution, and victimology will be covered.",

                        "Moreover, in the sample identified by the SHA256 hash fdada5ba799bd9f5270b218cfad543d99fde3eb7898fd9e3ee79603b643b3c48, the command-and-control domain is final[.]staticd[.]dynamic-dns[.]net, which resolved to 158[.]247[.]204[.]191. Pivoting on that IP, we identified two PCShare samples communicating to that IP, both of which use the same injection method into the Remote Desktop shared clipboard (RDPclip.exe). PCShare is an open-source backdoor, which has been leveraged by Chinese actors, as documented by BlackBerry. Additionally, the same mutex (being 78de65b0701f3c9238a37) is used as the ones reported by Recorded Future.",
                        "PlugX has been associated with various Chinese actors in recent years. This fact raises the question if the malwares code base is shared among different Chinese state-backed groups. On the other hand, the alleged leak of the PlugX v1 builder, as reported by Airbus in 2015, indicates that not all occurrences of PlugX are necessarily tied to Chinese actors.",
                        "Within the custom structure, the signature field often corresponds to PLUG. In other variants, a different value is used, such as the THOR version that Unit42 wrote about. The Talisman variant uses the constant value 0xCF455089 as a signature, which decodes to the Chinese characters using the UTF16-LE encoding and translates to crotch in English. Other versions are named based on their signature but given Talismans rude signature word we opted for a different name.",
                        "In this blog we have analysed the different steps the infamous PlugX RAT follows to start execution and avoid detection. Moreover, we highlighted several interesting characteristics of a new variant that we dubbed Talisman. During the technical analysis, we extracted various network artifacts that allowed us to not only find new samples, but also analyse the infrastructure overlap with a known Chinese state-backed group. This information, together with the analysis of the victims where we observed this PlugX variant, allowed us to attribute this campaign with medium confidence to the RedFoxtrot APT group, which is otherwise known as Nomad Panda.",
                        "We have observed the Talisman malware in a campaign which targets the telecommunication and defense sectors in South Asia. Moreover, the targets line up with the Chinese efforts to protect the Belt and Road Initiative, a program that aims to establish strong socioeconomically relationships across Europe, Asia, and Africa.",
                        "We want to mention that a change within the PlugX malware alone does not mean a new threat actor has emerged. The PlugX source code has allegedly circulated online already. This also means that not all PlugX samples are necessarily tied to Chinese actors, although it a prevalent tool in their kit. In the case of Talisman, there is more evidence which points towards a Chinese state-backed actor than a simple change in the malwares codebase, such as the overlaps in the used infrastructure, which is also present in Recorded Futures research. Based on this, Trellix attributes this campaign with medium confidence to the Chinese state-backed RedFoxtrot group.",
                        "The South Asian region is of strategic interest for China for various reasons. Firstly, the stability in South Asia is a global concern, making it a logical focus area for all superpowers, including China. Secondly, companies in the telecommunication and defense sectors provide unique insights for attackers and are often targeted. Thirdly, given the military presence of multiple superpowers in the region, and the geographic location in relation to China, this area can be considered a priority for Chinese sponsored groups.",
                        "Most Talisman PlugX samples we analyzed consist of three-file long execution chains abusing the DLL sideloading technique, which is consistent with the tactics, techniques, and procedures of Chinese state-sponsored threat actors that use this type of execution to launch their malware to evade detection by security solutions.",
                        "However, based on our analysis of the infrastructure overlaps with Recorded Futures related research, we assess with medium confidence that the Talisman PlugX variant discussed in this blog is used by RedFoxtrot/Nomad Panda, a Chinese state sponsored actor. The victimology is in-line with the targets of this group as well. We have no evidence that this variant is exclusively used by this threat actor, instead we believe that Talisman could be shared among different Chinese groups to carry out their operations."

Pivoting on that IP, we identified two PCShare samples communicating to that IP, both of which use the same injection method into the Remote Desktop shared clipboard (RDPclip.exe). PCShare is an open-source backdoor, which has been leveraged by Chinese actors, as documented by BlackBerry.

In the case of Talisman, there is more evidence which points towards a Chinese state-backed actor than a simple change in the malwares codebase, such as the overlaps in the used infrastructure, which is also present in Recorded Futures research.

                        "In this blog we have analysed the different steps the infamous PlugX RAT follows to start execution and avoid detection. Moreover, we highlighted several interesting characteristics of a new variant that we dubbed Talisman. During the technical analysis, we extracted various network artifacts that allowed us to not only find new samples, but also analyse the infrastructure overlap with a known Chinese state-backed group. This information, together with the analysis of the victims where we observed this PlugX variant, allowed us to attribute this campaign with medium confidence to the RedFoxtrot APT group, which is otherwise known as Nomad Panda.",

                        "However, based on our analysis of the infrastructure overlaps with Recorded Futures related research, we assess with medium confidence that the Talisman PlugX variant discussed in this blog is used by RedFoxtrot/Nomad Panda, a Chinese state sponsored actor. The victimology is in-line with the targets of this group as well. We have no evidence that this variant is exclusively used by this threat actor, instead we believe that Talisman could be shared among different Chinese groups to carry out their operations."

The string encryption is based on simple XOR cipher, where the encrypted string is first created on the stack. The characters of the encrypted string are then decrypted and stored at the location of the encrypted character. Once the decryption loop has finished, the decrypted string will be stored on the stack. The image below shows the decryption of a string. Note that both ascii and wide strings are used within the program, which can cause some confusion when decrypting the strings with the wrong encoding."

During the technical analysis, we extracted various network artifacts that allowed us to not only find new samples, but also analyse the infrastructure overlap with a known Chinese state-backed group. This information, together with the analysis of the victims where we observed this PlugX variant, allowed us to attribute this campaign with medium confidence to the RedFoxtrot APT group, which is otherwise known as Nomad Panda."

The shellcode resolves all functions it requires and handles the decryption and the decompression of the given data blob. Additionally, the MZ-header and PE-header are verified using the offsets of 0 and 0x4550 respectively, which correspond to fields named e_magic and e_lfanew. The entry point of the newly decrypted PE file is stored in the custom structure as well. The image below shows the checks and structure field assignments in the pseudocode overview.",

These articles describe other versions of PlugX and were of help to us during the analysis of this variant to both understand and compare the different iterations of the malware. Talisman has some differences with other PlugX versions. In the coming sections, we will highlight interesting segments of the malware. Below, a visual overview of the malwares stages is given.",

This overlaps with the RedFoxtrot group, on which Recorded Future already reported.",
                        "The first stage of the malware is a benign executable which is used to evade the prying eyes of security products as valid signatures often help to indicate the trustworthiness of a binary. The signed executables in this campaign have been created by security companies. The sole purpose of the first stage is to load a DLL which has been modified by the attacker. Sideloading a DLL is a commonly seen technique in various PlugX variants, as is also described on the respective MITRE ATT&CK page. Lastly, a third binary file, containing the encrypted Talisman payload, is decrypted by the DLL to complete the full chain of execution.",

                        "We want to mention that a change within the PlugX malware alone does not mean a new threat actor has emerged. The PlugX source code has allegedly circulated online already. This also means that not all PlugX samples are necessarily tied to Chinese actors, although it a prevalent tool in their kit. In the case of Talisman, there is more evidence which points towards a Chinese state-backed actor than a simple change in the malwares codebase, such as the overlaps in the used infrastructure, which is also present in Recorded Futures research. Based on this, Trellix attributes this campaign with medium confidence to the Chinese state-backed RedFoxtrot group.",

Some of these are embedded by default, as also described by the United States CISA: Disk, Nethood, Netstat, Option, PortMap, RegEdit, Service, Shell, SQL, and Telnet. The plug-in names are relatively self-explanatory, as their name indicates the type of activities that can be performed with them.

The Talisman variant uses the constant value 0xCF455089 as a signature, which decodes to the Chinese characters using the UTF16-LE encoding and translates to crotch in English. Other versions are named based on their signature but given Talismans rude signature word we opted for a different name.",

During the technical analysis, we extracted various network artifacts that allowed us to not only find new samples, but also analyse the infrastructure overlap with a known Chinese state-backed group. This information, together with the analysis of the victims where we observed this PlugX variant, allowed us to attribute this campaign with medium confidence to the RedFoxtrot APT group, which is otherwise known as Nomad Panda.",
