                        "Until recently, Emotets infection flow and execution included the first phase of malspam activity, which lures the user to open an attachment, thereby triggering a macro code to run on the victims system. In previous versions of Emotet, the macro would directly launch PowerShell to download the payload. After the macro phase, each version would act differently, for example, lateral spreading, dropping additional malware, and deploying Emotet modules. We have already witnessed Ryuk, Trickbot, and other notorious malware using Emotet to gain initial access.",
                        "Figure 2: Emotet regsvr32 command",
                        "Emotet, one of the first Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS), an ever-evolving botnet and banking trojan active since 2014, recently added new techniques to its arsenal. Initially intended to extract sensitive banking information from a victims computer and operate using other malware trojans, this notorious malware continues evolving by implementing new techniques in the malware delivery stage.",
                        "Cyberint Research Team has detected 45 LNK samples over the past month; most of the LNK files appeared as Emotet-related and shared the same cmdlets structure. However, the Powershell employment using the LNK technique appeared in the wild in 2021 while being used in the Document Stealer OutSteel and the Downloader SaintBot, according to Unit 42 Report. Emotet operators might become inspired by the technique and implement it in their infection chain.",

                        "In recent versions of Emotet, we detected something different in the infection chain: The macro code that was previously in use has been replaced with an LNK file.",
                        "The LNK initiates an encoded Powershell code, which calls regsvr32.exe (Windows command-line utility to register and unregister OLE controls) from the Syswow64 folder to run the payload, allowing 32-bit binary to run in 64-bit OS. This might indicate that Emotets new variants will drop the ability to act on 32-bit OS.",
