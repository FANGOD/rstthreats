                        "An additional screenshot led us to the actors GitLab account, which was continuously updated with the latest Mars Stealer builds under the name of Tony Mont, which has been active since late November 2021. We are assuming they do this for automation purposes.",
                        "We looked at the actors screenshots and discovered they were debugging their Mars Stealer builds using HTTP Analyzer. This revealed their second Mars Stealer C2 - http://5.45.84[.]214 which was improperly configured, similar to the first C2.",
                        "Spam email is the most common distribution method for Mars Stealer, as a compressed executable, download link, or document payload. Creating a malicious website masquerading as pirated software is another common method for spreading this infostealer.",
                        "Fortunately, the actor compromised his own computer with the Mars Stealer while debugging. This allowed us a rare peek into an operation by looking at his own stolen informationscreenshots, passwords, history, system information, etc. Below is an image we generated to summarize the actors most relevant activity details.",
                        "Below is a fully cloned website masquerading as the official openoffice.org website to lure victims to download the Mars Stealer.",
                        "In this campaign, the actor distributed Mars Stealer via cloned websites offering well-known software. They used the Google Ads advertising platform to trick victims searching for the original software into visiting a malicious site instead. The actor is paying for these Google Ads campaigns using stolen information (see figure 15). The example below is one of many demonstrating how the actor targets Canadians by using geographically targeted Google Ads.",
                        "Morphisec protects against advanced attack chains such as those used in the Mars stealer. We do this with our patented Moving Target Defense (MTD) technology, which blocks advanced and zero-day attacks. MTD uses system polymorphism to hide application assets, operating system assets, and other critical assets from adversaries. This leads to unpredictable and dramatically reduced attack surfaces.",
                        "Infostealers offer an accessible entry point to criminal activity. For example, only $160 gets you a lifetime subscription to Mars Stealer. You can purchase infostealers on Dark Web forums without any vetting, unlike more sophisticated tools such as ransomware, which require you to have a reputation amongst other cybercriminals. Infostealers empower novice cybercriminals to build a reputation they can leverage to acquire more powerful malware from more sophisticated actors.",
                        "Figure 1: Mars stealer post on hacking forums.",
                        "Whoever released the cracked Mars Stealer without official support has led threat actors to improperly configure their environment, exposing critical assets to the world.",
                        "Morphisec Labs will keep monitoring the Mars Stealer and provide updates when appropriate. Infostealers are used by a wide variety of cybercriminals, from novices to state-sponsored actors. Theyre easy to acquireand they work. Mars is currently being promoted in over 47 different underground forums, Darknet onion sites, and Telegram channels, and even has an official Telegram channel for purchasing through.",
                        "Figure 2: Cracked Mars Stealer instruction guide.",
                        "The Morphisec Labs team has conducted research on the new Mars infostealer. Mars is based on the older Oski Stealer and was first discovered in June 2021. The new Mars is available for sale on several underground forums and is reported to be under constant development. The Mars Stealer pilfers user credentials stored in various browsers, as well as many different cryptocurrency wallets. Mars Stealer is being distributed via social engineering techniques, malspam campaigns, malicious software cracks, and keygens. (For more about infostealers, read Morphisecs coverage of the Jupyter infostealer.)",
